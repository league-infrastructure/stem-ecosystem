# Partner roster expansion + data housekeeping

## Description

The 153-partner roster was inherited from the Drupal site and never
re-surveyed. Register the organizations the 2026-08-30 research found
(as sources where scrapable, and as partner-directory entries either
way — they are also a recruitment list for Fleet/League outreach):

**Housekeeping (existing partner data):**
- Water Conservation Garden URL → thegarden.org (working TEC REST).
- SDSU MESA URL mep.sdsu.edu → mesa.sdsu.edu (301s today).
- batiquitosfoundation.org is HIJACKED (spam) — never link it; the real
  site is batiquitoslagoon.org. Audit other partner URLs for the same.
- Duplicate partner rows in partners_viable.csv (Living Coast ×2,
  EIS ×2, GSDSEF ×2, SDRPF ×2, Fleet ×2, Viasat ×2, Media Arts ×2,
  Ocean Connectors ×2, SD Futures ×2, Salk ×2) break the
  found→published join — dedupe or canonicalize.
- Defunct (mark, don't register): EarthFair, Maker Faire San Diego,
  Fab Lab SD, SD Makers Guild, SD Science Alliance, KidzToPros.
- Academic Connections canceled 2026; JCVI La Jolla internships paused
  2026 — record as negative signals so nobody re-registers them blind.
