## 1. Purpose

`registry/` is the data-driven catalog of *what* the system scrapes and *how to reach it*:
one TOML file per organization, plus three parallel catalogs for hubs, ads, and
unpromoted candidates. It is a subsystem because it is the codebase's configuration
boundary — the deliberate seam that makes onboarding a new partner organization a data
edit rather than a code change. It owns the schemas those files must satisfy and the
loaders that turn them into typed objects, and it owns the *physical separation* between
catalogs that must never be confused with one another.

**(Sprint 014)** This sprint is squarely an exercise of that "onboarding is a data
edit" design point, at higher volume than any prior sprint: roughly 33 existing
`sources/` entries get a triage disposition (fixed / re-typed / flagged headless /
disabled-with-reason), two known mis-registrations are corrected
(`sd-river-park-foundation`'s `adapter_type`, `sandiego-gov`'s `org_name`/`site_url`
mismatch), and roughly 20 new entries are added against already-existing adapters. No
schema, loader, or catalog-separation change is needed for any of it — see §6.

## 2. Orientation

Four data directories, three schema/loader pairs:

| Directory | Schema | Loader | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sources/` | `schema.SourceConfig` | `loader.load_sources` / `load_active_sources` | ~101 organizations before sprint 014; ~120 after |
| `hubs/` | `hub_schema.HubConfig` | `hub_schema.load_hubs` | curated lead-generation hubs |
| `ads/` | `export.ads.AdConfig` | `export.ads.load_ad_configs` | hand-authored ad slots |
| `candidates/` | `candidates.CandidateStub` | `candidates.list_candidates` | discovered orgs awaiting human promotion |

A `SourceConfig` is `source_id` (the TOML filename stem), `org_name`, `adapter_type`,
`config`, plus optional `taxonomy_defaults`, `acquisition_policy`, and `enabled`.
`config`, `taxonomy_defaults`, and `acquisition_policy` are plain dicts, not sub-schemas.
`acquisition_policy` is where `fetch_strategy` (`"static"` / `"headless"`) and `max_urls`
(default 300) live.

A `HubConfig` is much smaller — `hub_id`, `hub_name`, `page_urls`, `config` — with no
`adapter_type` and no `acquisition_policy`, because a hub is a place to look for
organizations, never a place to acquire events from.

`candidates.py` writes review-marked TOML stubs containing only `org_name`,
`candidate_url`, `discovered_via`, and `evidence_text`.

## 3. Constraints and Invariants

- **A malformed or missing-required-field file is logged and skipped, never fatal.** With
  ~100 source files, one bad edit must not take the whole run down. Both `load_sources`
  and `load_hubs` catch `InvalidSourceConfig`/`InvalidHubConfig` and `TOMLDecodeError`
  per file.
- **`hubs/`, `ads/`, and `candidates/` are physically separate from `sources/` and are
  never in `loader.DEFAULT_SOURCES_DIR`'s scan path.** This is the primary safety
  property preventing a hub — another aggregator's listing — from being treated as a live
  event source.
- **A candidate stub deliberately omits `adapter_type` and `config`,** so that even a
  misdirected `load_sources()` pointed at `candidates/` fails
  `SourceConfig.from_toml`'s required-field check rather than silently succeeding. This is
  belt-and-suspenders behind the directory separation, and it is why promotion is a
  deliberate human edit: a stub is *not* a valid source until someone fills in how to
  reach it.
- **`load_sources` returns disabled entries; `load_active_sources` filters them.**
  Disabling a source must be a one-line `enabled = false` edit, not a file deletion, so
  the entry still round-trips through the loader and its history is preserved. The
  Pipeline uses `load_active_sources`; anything auditing the catalog uses `load_sources`.
- **`source_id` is the TOML filename stem.** It is the join key for the enrichment cache,
  the sitemap snapshot, the yield-history snapshot, and the export's source attribution.
  Renaming a file orphans all four.
- **`config` / `taxonomy_defaults` / `acquisition_policy` stay untyped dicts.** Different
  `adapter_type`s need genuinely different shapes (`api_base` for `tec_rest`, `feed_url`
  for `ical`, a board token for `greenhouse`). Over-typing them would need revisiting on
  every new adapter, and the validation that matters — "does this adapter understand this
  config?" — can only happen in the adapter anyway.
- **Deliberate non-goal — no fetching, no adapter knowledge.** This subsystem parses and
  validates files. It does not know what an adapter does with the config it hands over,
  and it must not grow adapter-specific validation.

## 4. Design

**One file per organization.** The alternative — one large catalog file — was rejected
because the registry is edited by humans, reviewed in pull requests, and grows by one
entry at a time. Per-file granularity makes a diff show exactly which organization
changed, and makes the "skip the bad file, keep the other hundred" isolation natural
rather than something a parser has to reconstruct.

**Why `hub_schema.py` is one module while sources are split across `schema.py` and
`loader.py`.** A hub definition is a much smaller shape, so a schema/loader split adds no
real separation of concerns. The asymmetry is deliberate, not an oversight.

**`from_toml` classmethods do the validation.** Each schema owns its own required-field
check and raises its own exception type (`InvalidSourceConfig`, `InvalidHubConfig`,
`InvalidAdConfig`), which the directory loader catches. Validation lives next to the shape
it validates.

**Where the ads catalog lives.** `registry/ads/` holds the data but
`export/ads.py` holds its schema and loader — the one place the four catalogs are not
symmetric. The ad contract is an output-side concern (it exists to write `ads.json`) and
was built with the export it feeds; only its *data* belongs alongside the other
hand-curated catalogs.

**`tomllib`, not a dependency.** Standard library since Python 3.11; the package requires
3.13.

## 5. Interfaces

### Exposes
- **`load_active_sources(directory=None) -> list[SourceConfig]`** — the enabled subset;
  what `pipeline.run()` calls. Defaults to `DEFAULT_SOURCES_DIR`.
- **`load_sources(directory=None) -> list[SourceConfig]`** — the full parseable set,
  including disabled entries. Never raises for a bad file; logs and skips.
- **`SourceConfig`**, **`SourceConfig.from_toml(path)`**, **`InvalidSourceConfig`**,
  **`DEFAULT_SOURCES_DIR`**, **`DEFAULT_MAX_URLS_PER_SOURCE`** (300).
- **`HubConfig`**, **`HubConfig.from_toml(path)`**, **`load_hubs(directory=None)`**,
  **`InvalidHubConfig`**, **`DEFAULT_HUBS_DIR`**.
- **`write_candidate(candidate, directory=None) -> CandidateStub`** — persists one
  `OrgCandidate` as a review stub, skipping near-duplicates of existing stubs.
  **`list_candidates(directory=None)`**, **`CandidateStub`**, **`DEFAULT_CANDIDATES_DIR`**.

### Consumes
- **`discovery.hub_scan.OrgCandidate`** — the input to `write_candidate`. The only
  inbound type dependency this subsystem has, and it is data-only.

Otherwise nothing: `registry/` sits near the bottom of the dependency graph, consumed by
`adapters/`, `discovery/`, and `pipeline.py`.

## 5b. Data conventions

`acquisition_policy` keys in use today:
- `fetch_strategy` — `"static"` (default) or `"headless"`; read only by `pipeline.run()`.
- `max_urls` — per-source discovery cap, default 300; enforced by `adapters.base.run`.
- `rate_limit_seconds` and other politeness knobs are passed through to `PoliteFetcher`.

`taxonomy_defaults` supplies `Opportunity` fields that cannot be derived from event text
(contact details, `financial_support`, `ngss_aligned`, and similar), applied during
`normalize/`'s mapping stage.

## 6. Open Questions / Known Limitations

- There is no schema validation for the contents of `config`, so a typo in a key an
  adapter expects surfaces as a zero-yield run rather than a load error. The yield report
  in `observability/` is the only signal.
- `registry/candidates/` does not exist on disk yet; the discovery flow that populates it
  has not been run against real hubs at volume.
- Only one hub and one ad are configured today. Neither catalog has been exercised with
  multiple entries in production.
- Promotion from a candidate stub to a live source is entirely manual and undocumented
  beyond the stub's own fields — there is no checklist for choosing an `adapter_type`.
- Disabled sources accumulate. Nothing reports how many entries are `enabled = false` or
  why. **(Sprint 014, partial)** The "or why" half is now addressed by convention, not
  tooling: this sprint's triage ticket disables sources with an inline reason comment
  (`enabled = false  # disabled: <reason>`, e.g. `olivewood-gardens.toml`'s existing
  precedent), so a human reading the file always sees why. The "how many, in aggregate"
  half — a report or count across the catalog — is still unbuilt; this remains a real
  gap for a future sprint, not resolved here.
- **(Sprint 014)** `source_id` correctness (the constraint in §3: it's the join key for
  four separate subsystems) was violated in the wild before this sprint —
  `sandiego-gov.toml`'s `org_name` named an entirely different organization than its
  `site_url`. This sprint's triage ticket corrects it, but the registry itself still has
  no automated check that `org_name` and `site_url` (or any other field pair) are
  mutually consistent — the §3 "no schema validation for the contents of `config`"
  limitation extends to this kind of cross-field consistency too, and a similar
  mismatch could recur silently for any other source.
