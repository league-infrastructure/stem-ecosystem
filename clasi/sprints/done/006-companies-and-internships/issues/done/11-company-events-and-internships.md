# Expansion: San Diego STEM companies — events and internships

Extend the aggregator beyond nonprofit/education partners to STEM employers:
their public events and, more valuably, their **internships**. Turns the
directory into a career-pathway resource.

## Why

Career pathways are mission-aligned and highly fundable (cf. the NBCUniversal
"youth education and pathways to careers" grant). This strengthens both the
product and the case to keep the site alive.

## Proposed scope

- **Company seed list** — curate ~50–100 San Diego STEM employers (sources:
  SD Regional EDC, BIOCOM, CONNECT, anchor firms, the Fleet's corporate
  sponsors). Curated, not web-crawled.
- **Internships via ATS adapters** — Greenhouse and Lever expose public JSON
  board APIs; filter to internships / early-career + local + STEM. (Workday /
  iCIMS later.)
- **Internship as a distinct opportunity kind** — deadline/term date
  semantics (application deadline, "Summer 2027"), "apply" CTA, HS/college
  audience — not the event datetime model. Likely its own site
  section/filter (coordinate with the site repo).
- **Company public events** — opportunistic generic-extractor capture (open
  houses, career fairs, hackathons); low yield, don't over-invest.

## Sequence

Depends on: 01, 04, 05 (needs the schema/kind extension). Parallel track to
the partner-event work; sequence vs. depth is a stakeholder call.

_Proposal / mock-up — rewrite freely._
