# teams

**Owner:** Eric Busboom · **Last reviewed:** 2026-08-28 (sprint 012 — FLL static roster added) · **Status:** all five increments complete (FTC + FRC + geocoding + site pages + FLL static roster)

---

## 1. Purpose

`partner_scrape/teams/` acquires, locates, and publishes San Diego
County's FIRST robotics teams (FTC via FTCScout, FRC via The Blue
Alliance) as a standalone `teams.json` data contract, structurally
independent of the existing `Opportunity` pipeline. It is a subsystem
of its own — not folded into `adapters/`/`normalize/`/`export/` —
because a `Team` is a fundamentally different kind of record: a
standing entity with no date, no recurrence, and no relevance-gating
need, none of which the existing pipeline's abstractions are built
around. The seam this subsystem owns is "acquire, locate, and publish
an undated directory entity," which nothing else in the codebase does.

## 2. Orientation

**Ticket 011-004 added the offline geocoding ladder — the increment
that actually delivers the sprint's stated goal of *knowing where the
teams are*.** `teams.pipeline.run_teams()` runs both sources, links
cross-league identity, and geocodes every merged `Team` through
`teams.geo.geocode_teams()` before export. Measured at ticket 011-004's
own build (2026-08-28) against the *original* 211-team FTC+FRC test
corpus (152 FTC + a hand-authored 59-team TBA fixture, since
superseded — see below): **129 teams at school precision** (79 FTC +
50 FRC), **8 at ZIP**, **70 at city**, **4 unresolved** (`"none"` — two
Ensenada teams, plus two out-of-region teams whose city name is too
ambiguous to guess, "San Antonio"/"Louisville"), **14 flagged
`needs_review`**. This distribution described the *test fixture's*
corpus at that build, not a live measurement — see the next paragraph
for why that distinction turned out to matter.

**Ticket 011-005 adds the `/teams` site section — the last increment
of `sprint.md`'s Migration Concerns chain (001→002→003→004→005)** —
and is the ticket that makes the whole sprint visible to a site
visitor. It builds no new Python code in this subsystem at all; it is
purely a consumer of `teams.json`, exactly as `sprint.md`'s Impact on
Existing Components anticipated. See "Site Presentation Layer" below
for what it built.

**Ticket 011-003 was reopened (2026-08-28) for a sprint-validation
defect: a live `partner-scrape teams` run returned only 19 FRC teams,
not the ~59 the original ticket measured.** Root cause: TBA's
`/api/v3/teams/{page}` reports the *full* state name (`"California"`)
for the majority of San Diego County records (59 of the real 78) and
only the bare USPS abbreviation (`"CA"`) for the rest (19) —
`sources.tba._extract_one()`'s original filter compared `state_prov`
to the literal string `"CA"` with no normalization, so it matched only
the minority 19 and silently dropped the majority 59. The ticket
011-003 test fixture used `"CA"` for every hand-authored record, so
this was never caught in tests. **Fix:** `sources.tba._normalize_state()`
normalizes any recognized full US state name to its USPS abbreviation
before the comparison runs (see Interfaces). **On the 19 `"CA"`-abbreviated
records themselves:** confirmed live (`/team/frcNNNN/years_participated`)
that every one is a genuine historical San Diego County FRC team —
real schools, real addresses, several with real working websites — but
all 19 last competed in or before 2014 (two never competed at all),
while the "California"-labeled 59 skew far more recent (40 of 59 last
competed 2023 or later). This age/format correlation is why the bug
went undercounted for so long, but it is not a legitimacy signal: TBA's
team roster is an append-only historical registry with no "active"
flag (`model.Team.active` is not populated by any source; see
Constraints below), so an old profile that has never been rewritten to
the full state name is still a real San Diego County team, exactly the
same way a "California"-labeled but similarly stale record already in
the 59 is. Excluding the 19 would require inventing a new
activity-based filter this subsystem has never had (neither source
filters by recency), which was judged out of scope for a filter-format
bugfix. **Corrected total, confirmed via a real `partner-scrape teams
--dry-run` run (2026-08-28): 78 FRC teams, 230 overall (152 FTC + 78
FRC)** — see Interfaces for the corrected `SD_COUNTY_CITIES` figure and
Open Questions for the full before/after. The *committed test fixture*
(`tests/fixtures/teams/tba_teams_page0.json`/`page1.json`) was rebuilt
from real, live-captured records but deliberately kept small (7 of the
78 real matches, plus real noise records) rather than growing to the
full 78 — see `tests/teams/test_sources_tba.py`'s module docstring —
so the fixture-driven test corpus is now 159 teams (152 FTC + 7 FRC),
not 211; every count elsewhere in this document that cites "211" or
"59" describes that now-superseded original fixture unless marked
otherwise.

**Sprint 012 adds the fifth and final increment: a static FLL roster.**
Sprint 011 deliberately deferred First LEGO League (48 teams) because
there is no public FLL API and no third-party aggregator — probed and
confirmed at issue-write time. The only source is a hand-maintained,
dated export living in a sibling repo
(`../robot-team-analysis/fll/sd-fll-teams-contact-list.md`), which also
carries contact data (40 email addresses, six of them volunteer
coaches' personal Gmail accounts) this project has never published and
structurally cannot — `model.Team` has no `email` field, by design (see
Constraints). `teams.sources.static_roster.StaticRosterSource` reads a
committed, already-contact-stripped roster file under `teams/data/` and
never calls the injected `Fetcher` — a "source" in name and protocol
shape only; there is no acquisition step to isolate a failure from, only
a file read. Registered via a new `teams/registry/fll-sd.toml` entry
(`adapter_type = "static_roster"`) alongside the two live sources, it
needed zero changes to `merge_teams()`, `geocode_teams()`, or
`export_teams()` — the pipeline stages after acquisition were already
source-agnostic by the design choices sprint 011 made (see Design,
below, for the specific paragraph that anticipated this). Because FLL's
2026-27 season is announced as the program's last ever (LEGO declined to
renew its FIRST partnership, 2026-03-19), the registry entry also
carries `sunset_season = "2026-27"`; `run_teams()` logs a WARNING once
`date.today()` passes that season rather than silently continuing to
publish undated-feeling "current" data for a program that no longer
exists. Expected total once this ships: **278 teams (152 FTC + 78 FRC +
48 FLL)** — see Open Questions for the real-run confirmation this
sprint requires before close, matching the ticket 011-003 lesson
(commit a fixture built from real captured data, then verify against a
live run, not just the fixture suite).

```

A freshly-extracted `Team` from either source still has
`location_precision == "none"` and no coordinates until
`teams.geo.geocode_teams()` runs — that stage now runs on every
`run_teams()` call, so `teams.json` carries real coordinates for most
teams as of this ticket. `cli.py` still imports only
`teams.pipeline.run_teams` — the one and only edge from any existing,
non-`teams/` module into this subsystem; `teams.geo` itself has zero
edges into `partner_scrape.fetch` or any other network-capable module
(see Constraints and `teams/geo.py`'s own docstring).

**FTCScout**, `api.ftcscout.org`, free, unauthenticated. Its REST
search endpoint returns 152 San Diego FTC teams in one response — no
pagination, no probing needed, one `TeamRef` per run. It supplies city
and (62% of the time) a school name, but confirmed live: no website and
no ZIP for any of the 152 records (0/3,412 nationally too).

**The Blue Alliance (this ticket)**, `www.thebluealliance.com/api/v3`,
keyed (`X-TBA-Auth-Key`, 401 without it). Unlike FTCScout, TBA has no
region-scoped search endpoint — `discover()` first probes `/api/v3/
status` for `max_team_page` (23 measured live), then enumerates every
`/api/v3/teams/{page}` (~9,163 teams worldwide, 659 in California --
496 reporting the full state name `"California"`, 163 the bare
abbreviation `"CA"`), filtering down to the 78 in `sources.tba.
SD_COUNTY_CITIES` (an allowlist — see Constraints below for why it
must be one, unlike FTCScout's denylist) after normalizing
`state_prov` to a USPS abbreviation (`_normalize_state()`, ticket
011-003 reopened — see Open Questions for why this normalization step
exists). TBA is the first real source of website (68% of the 78) and
ZIP (87%) coverage; its `lat`/`lng`/`address`/`location_name`/
`gmaps_place_id` fields are
documented in TBA's own OpenAPI spec as "Will be NULL, for future
development" and confirmed NULL for all 78 SD teams, so this source
never reads them at all — **TBA is not a geocoding source**; only
ticket 011-004's `geo.py` sets `Team.latitude`/`longitude`.

## 3. Constraints and Invariants

- **Never register with `adapters.base.ADAPTERS`.** A team source
  registered there would become reachable from `pipeline.run()`, which
  would hand a `Team` object to `normalize.run()` — a type it does not
  expect — and crash. `TeamSource` (`sources/base.py`) is a separate
  `Protocol` with no import relationship to `adapters.base` at all —
  `tests/teams/test_sources_base.py` enforces this by scanning every
  module actually shipped in `teams/sources/` for a forbidden import,
  so a future addition (e.g. `sources/tba.py`) that violates it fails
  the same test, not just today's code.
- **No `email` field, structurally, on `model.Team`.** A follow-on
  sprint may eventually ingest `data/robot-teams.json` (40 email
  addresses, including six volunteer coaches' personal Gmail
  accounts); there is nowhere on this dataclass to put one.
  `tests/teams/test_model.py`'s `TestNoEmailField` asserts this by
  inspecting `dataclasses.fields(Team)` directly, not by convention.
- **FTCScout uses its REST endpoint, not GraphQL.** `fetch.Fetcher`
  (`fetch/fetcher.py`) is GET-only; adding a `post()` method to support
  GraphQL would ripple into every `FixtureFetcher` test double in the
  whole suite for this one source's benefit.
- **Out-of-region FTC teams are flagged, never dropped.** A team whose
  (cleaned) city is in `sources.ftcscout.OUT_OF_REGION_CITIES` (6 of
  152 FTC teams: Ensenada ×2, San Clemente, San Antonio, Louisville,
  Agoura Hills) is published with `Team.in_region = False`, not
  excluded. The set is a denylist, not an allowlist — an unrecognized
  new city defaults to `in_region=True`, which is the safer failure
  mode (a real San Diego community not yet seen must never be silently
  flagged out-of-region because it's missing from a hand-maintained
  list).
- **`sources.tba.SD_COUNTY_CITIES` must be an allowlist, unlike
  FTCScout's denylist above — and this is deliberate, not an
  inconsistency.** FTCScout's `region=USCASD` search endpoint already
  pre-filters to a rough San Diego-area geographic box, so its residual
  6-city denylist only needs to catch stragglers. TBA's `/api/v3/
  teams/{page}` has no region parameter at all — it enumerates every
  FRC team worldwide (~9,163) — so `sources/tba.py` must actively
  select the 78 that are in San Diego County, both by `state_prov`
  (normalized to `"CA"` via `_normalize_state()` — ticket 011-003,
  reopened; see Open Questions) and by `city` matching this allowlist.
  An unrecognized San Diego city is a silent *undercount* here (the
  opposite failure mode from FTCScout's denylist), surfaced via
  `meta.by_league["FRC"]` reading lower than the measured 78 — that
  count is the first place to check if this list ever needs a new
  entry.
- **`sources.tba.TBASource.discover()` raises on any probe failure; it
  does not degrade gracefully the way `adapters/tec.py`'s pagination
  probe does (falling back to "assume 1 page").** A missing/invalid
  `TBA_KEY`, a non-200/401 `/api/v3/status` response, or an unparseable
  body all raise `RuntimeError` from `discover()`. There is no sane
  page-count fallback for a credential failure — guessing would still
  401 on every subsequent page fetch, just less honestly. Raising here
  is exactly what lets `teams.pipeline.run_teams()`'s existing
  per-source try/except (ticket 011-002, unchanged by this ticket)
  isolate it: log, skip TBA, continue with whatever FTCScout already
  contributed. This is the mechanism that satisfies sprint.md's
  Migration Concerns — a missing/401 `TBA_KEY` degrades a `teams` run
  to FTC-only output, never aborts it — with **zero TBA-specific
  special-casing in `pipeline.py`** beyond registering the source in
  `_TEAM_SOURCES`. `tests/teams/test_pipeline.py`'s
  `TestTbaFailureIsolation` covers both cases end-to-end.
- **Cross-league organizational identity keys on normalized
  organization name, never on team number.** `teams.merge.merge_teams()`
  links `Team.org_key`/`sibling_team_ids` by
  `normalize.partners.normalize_org_name`-normalized `Team.organization`
  — reused directly, not reimplemented. `Team.team_id` already
  guarantees per-league uniqueness by construction
  (`f"{league.lower()}-{number}"`), so number collisions across leagues
  never produce a duplicate ID, but a naive number-based *link* would
  still be wrong: FTC 1622 and FRC 1622 are both real, both at Poway
  High School (a genuine dual-program link, correctly made by org
  name), while FTC 812 and FRC 812 are at *different* schools (measured
  — a number-based link would be actively wrong here, and org-name
  linking correctly makes none). Linking never fuses records — every
  `Team` a group produces stays a separate object; only `org_key` and
  `sibling_team_ids` are set. `Family/Community` and any other
  empty-`organization` team gets `org_key = ""` and is excluded from
  grouping entirely (never linked to anything, including other
  empty-organization teams) — without this, 58 unrelated FTC home teams
  would fuse into one bogus ~60-team "organization." See `merge.py`'s
  own module docstring for the full rationale and
  `tests/teams/test_merge.py` for the dual-program/never-groups/
  number-collision test cases.
- **`merge_teams()` runs once, after every source has completed and
  before `teams.geo.geocode_teams()` — never inside the per-source
  acquisition loop.** Cross-league
  identity needs the *combined* `Team[]` from every source that
  succeeded; running it per-source would see only one league at a time
  and could never link anything. `teams.pipeline.run_teams()` calls it
  exactly once, after the source loop, and does not wrap it in its own
  try/except — unlike source acquisition (network I/O, expected to
  fail sometimes), `merge_teams()` operates on already-validated
  in-memory `Team` objects and never raises for any input it can
  receive there.
- **Dirty city strings are normalized at extraction time, not
  deferred.** Measured live: 27 raw distinct `city` strings for what
  is really 24 places (`"La Jolla "` with trailing whitespace,
  `"carlsbad"`/`"Carlsbad"`, `"san diego"`/`"San Diego"`).
  `sources/ftcscout._clean_city()` strips and title-cases every record
  before it becomes a `Team.city` value, so every later stage (merge,
  geocoding, site filters) sees one canonical string per place. This
  is a simple, sufficient fix for the variants actually observed — it
  is not a general place-name normalizer, and ticket 011-004's `geo.py`
  does the real matching against CDE/NCES school directories.
- **Sources still never geocode.** Neither `sources/ftcscout.py` nor
  `sources/tba.py` resolves coordinates; both leave
  `Team.latitude`/`longitude`/`location_precision` at their dataclass
  defaults (`None`/`None`/`"none"`) and `teams.merge.merge_teams()`
  never touches them either. That is exclusively `teams.geo.
  geocode_teams()`'s job (this ticket), sequenced after both sources
  and after `merge_teams()` specifically because its offline ladder
  needs real `postal_code` values, which only TBA supplies at any real
  rate (ticket 011-003).
- **`teams.geo` is fully offline — zero network calls, structurally,
  not just by convention.** Measured before this ticket was built
  (`clasi/sprints/011-robot-teams/issues/robot-teams-scrape-locate-and-
  publish-san-diego-first-teams.md`'s Geocoding section): Nominatim/OSM
  resolved only 25 of 62 distinct school names (41% failure) and
  returned an HTTP 429 on a second machine's very first request; the US
  Census geocoder found 0 matches for a bare school name (it parses
  street addresses, which this project does not have). `teams/geo.py`
  therefore reads only the five committed files under `teams/data/`
  and never imports `partner_scrape.fetch` or any of Python's own
  networking modules (`urllib`, `http`, `socket`, ...) —
  `tests/teams/test_geo.py`'s `TestZeroNetworkCalls` enforces this by
  AST-scanning `geo.py`'s own source (matching
  `test_sources_base.py`'s forbidden-import-scan precedent) *and* by
  asserting `geocode_teams()`/`SchoolIndex.__init__()` accept no
  `Fetcher`-shaped parameter at all — not merely "an unused one," so a
  future edit cannot silently wire one in. The only thing in this
  subsystem that touches the network is `dev/refresh_school_
  directories.py`, a standalone script run by hand roughly yearly,
  never imported by `teams.geo` or `teams.pipeline`.
- **No LLM fallback for geocoding, ever — a wrong pin is worse than no
  pin.** A team that exhausts all seven of `teams.geo`'s rungs gets
  `location_precision: "none"` and no coordinates, full stop. This is
  tested directly (`tests/teams/test_geo.py`'s `TestRung7NoMatch`) and
  is why rung 7 exists as a real, exercised code path rather than an
  unreachable default.
- **`teams.geo`'s cache is in-memory, scoped to one `SchoolIndex`
  instance/one `run_teams()` call — deliberately not a disk-persisted
  cache modeled on `enrich/cache.py`.** `EnrichmentCache` exists to
  avoid *paying for* a repeated LLM call (real money, real latency);
  nothing in `teams.geo`'s matching costs either — it is a few hundred
  organizations compared against ~1,000 in-repo TSV rows, sub-second
  even uncached. A disk cache would add real complexity (schema
  versioning, content-hash invalidation, a `SCRAPE_CACHE_DIR`
  dependency this offline module would otherwise never need) for no
  measurable benefit. What *is* reused from that module's design is the
  shape "cache hits and misses alike, keyed by identity, not by
  record" — `SchoolIndex` caches rungs 1-4's outcome (hit **or**
  confirmed miss) keyed by `geo.normalize_school_name(Team.
  organization)` alone, per the issue's own measurement that 94
  school-named FTC/FRC teams collapse onto ~58 distinct campuses (a
  per-team cache would repeat ~40% of the matching work).
  `tests/teams/test_geo.py`'s `TestPerSchoolNotPerTeamCaching` proves
  this via `SchoolIndex.match_calls`, a counter incremented only on an
  actual (uncached) ladder run.
- **`needs_review` reflects the fuzzy match's actual Jaccard score, not
  which rung (3 vs. 4) accepted it.** A rung-3 (within-city, ≥0.60)
  match that happens to score ≥0.85 is not flagged; a rung-4
  (county-wide, ≥0.80) match at exactly 0.80 is. Below 0.85 the match
  still publishes — a flagged guess beats a silent one — exactly the
  mechanism that would catch "Classical Academy Online" (an online
  school with no campus) fuzzy-matching its sponsoring district's
  building at a 0.70 score without a human ever ratifying it.
  `Team.matched_name` is set on every resolved team regardless of
  precision (`"ZIP 92037 centroid"`, `"San Diego (city centroid)"`,
  or a real school name) so "why is this team here?" always has a
  string answer — never set (`""`) only when `location_precision ==
  "none"`.
- **Normalizing "Poway High School" to match CDE's own official "Poway
  High" required stripping a small, deliberately narrow stopword set
  (`"school"`/`"schools"`/`"sch"`/`"the"`), not a general fuzzy
  matcher.** Measured live building this ticket: without this, ~72 of
  117 school-precision matches (61%) scored 0.60-0.80 purely from CDE
  almost never writing the word "School" itself, flooding
  `needs_review` with matches that were actually exactly correct.
  Grade-level/type words (`"high"`, `"middle"`, `"elementary"`,
  `"senior"`) are deliberately **not** stripped — they distinguish two
  real, different schools at the same place name (e.g. "Poway High" vs.
  a hypothetical "Poway Middle") and dropping them would risk a false
  match, not just a noisy flag. After this fix, `needs_review` count
  dropped to 14 of the original 211-team fixture corpus (13 of the
  real, live 230-team corpus as of ticket 011-003's reopening — see
  Orientation) — a small, meaningful residue (genuine wording
  differences like "Senior"/"Early College", plus the "Classical
  Academy Online" case itself), not matcher noise.
  `geo.normalize_school_name` is a small, separately-named normalizer
  local to `teams/geo.py` — deliberately not
  `normalize.partners.normalize_org_name`, which is scoped to
  partner-directory organization names, not place names (see Design,
  below, for why the two must not be conflated).
- **`geo.py`'s loader independently re-checks `Virtual`/`StatusType`
  rather than trusting `dev/refresh_school_directories.py` was run
  correctly.** The committed `sd-schools-public.tsv` already excludes
  `Virtual in {"F", "V"}` rows and ships `StatusType == "Active"` rows
  only, but `SchoolIndex`'s own TSV loader re-applies both filters (the
  Virtual reject unconditionally; "prefer Active over Closed" as a
  per-normalized-name dedup) — defense in depth, and the only way
  `tests/teams/test_geo.py`'s `TestVirtualRowRejected` and
  `TestRung2ExactMatch::test_closed_row_never_wins_over_active` can
  exercise this behavior directly via a hand-built fixture, independent
  of whether today's real data file happens to need it.
- **`teams/export.py` never writes or touches `opportunities.json` or
  `scrape-meta.json`.** Those are `export/writer.py`'s exclusive
  outputs; `scrape-meta.json` in particular carries the *opportunities*
  export's freshness timestamp, and a `teams` run overwriting it would
  make the site falsely claim opportunities were just refreshed.
  `teams.json` carries its own `meta.generated` timestamp instead. Two
  dedicated regression tests in `tests/teams/test_export.py` assert
  both files are byte-identical before and after a `teams` run, over
  the full 152-team fixture, not just a single hand-built `Team`.
- **`teams` is a CLI subcommand, never a flag on `run`.** Rosters
  refresh annually; opportunities refresh weekly. A TBA auth failure
  (this ticket's `sources/tba.py`) must never sit inside the same
  process/exit code as the weekly opportunities export. `cli.py`'s
  `_run_teams()` never calls `run`/`pipeline.run()`, and
  `tests/test_cli_teams.py` asserts the isolation in both directions
  (`teams` never reaches `pipeline.run()`; the no-subcommand path never
  reaches `run_teams()`).
- **`export_teams()` drops `Team.sources` from the published field
  set**, the same way `export/writer.py`'s `SITE_SCHEMA_FIELDS` drops
  `Opportunity.sources` — cross-source acquisition bookkeeping (which
  source(s) contributed a record) has no counterpart in the site's
  schema. `teams/export.py`'s `TEAMS_SCHEMA_FIELDS` is derived from
  `dataclasses.fields(Team)` the same drift-proof way, so a new field
  (this ticket's `org_key`/`sibling_team_ids`, confirmed live: they now
  publish with no `export.py` change; ticket 011-004's `latitude`/
  `longitude`/`location_precision` next) is published automatically
  with no `export.py` change required.
- **(Sprint 012) `sources/static_roster.py` never calls the injected
  `Fetcher`, structurally, not just by convention.** Every `TeamSource`
  method still takes `fetcher` as a parameter (the protocol shape is
  unchanged — `sources/base.py`'s `TeamSource` is a fixed three-method
  contract), but `StaticRosterSource.fetch()` reads the committed roster
  file straight off disk (`Path.read_text()`) and ignores the `fetcher`
  argument entirely; `discover()` returns a single `TeamRef` whose `url`
  is a local file path, never an HTTP URL. `tests/teams/
  test_sources_static_roster.py` asserts this with a `Fetcher` test
  double that raises on any call, run through the full `sources.base.run()`
  chain — a stronger guarantee than an unused-parameter convention, the
  same spirit as `test_sources_base.py`'s forbidden-import AST scan
  (Constraints, above) even though the mechanism here is a runtime
  assertion rather than a static one (an AST scan cannot prove a method
  *never calls* an object it legitimately imports the type of).
- **(Sprint 012) Contact fields are stripped at import time, never
  carried into this module.** The upstream roster
  (`../robot-team-analysis/fll/sd-fll-teams-contact-list.md`) carries
  email addresses; the *committed* roster file under `teams/data/` that
  `static_roster.py` actually reads has already had every contact column
  removed before it was committed — `StaticRosterSource.extract()` never
  sees a contact field, let alone filters one out. This is a stronger
  guarantee than "filter emails at extraction time" would have been: a
  bug in a filter can leak; a column that was never committed cannot.
  Combined with `model.Team` having no `email` field at all (existing
  invariant, above), there are now two independent layers between any
  upstream contact data and a published `Team`.
- **(Sprint 012) A `sunset_season` past its date degrades to a loud
  warning, never a failure.** `teams.pipeline.run_teams()` parses
  `SourceConfig.config["sunset_season"]` (a `"YYYY-YY"` string, e.g.
  `"2026-27"`) once per run for any active source that declares it, and
  logs `logging.WARNING` if `date.today()` is past the parsed season-end
  date — the FLL program's own last season is 2026-27, and this project
  has no way to know today what, if anything, replaces it (see Open
  Questions). The roster keeps publishing regardless; a sunset date is a
  staleness signal for an operator to notice and act on, not a reason to
  stop shipping data that may still be the best available answer.

## 4. Design

**Why `Team` is a new, separate model, not a widened `Opportunity`/
`Kind`.** A team is a standing entity with no date, and
`export/writer.py`'s current-and-upcoming filter would drop every one
of them; widening `Kind` would ripple into `enrich/`,
`normalize/run.py`, and `export/writer.py` for near-zero reuse (no
date, no recurrence, no relevance gate, no taxonomy in common). See
`sprint.md`'s Design Rationale for the full comparison.

**Why `organization`/`org_type` come from `schoolName`, mapped, not
copied.** FTCScout's `schoolName` field is populated for every record,
but 58 of 152 (38%) carry the literal sentinel `"Family/Community"` —
a home team with no sponsoring school, not an organization named
"Family/Community". `_extract_one()` maps that sentinel to
`organization=""`, `org_type="family_community"` specifically so
`merge.py` (this ticket) can key cross-league identity on a non-empty
normalized organization name without accidentally fusing 58 unrelated
home teams into one bogus "Family/Community" organization.
`sources/tba.py` mirrors this for FRC: TBA has no equivalent sentinel,
but an unaffiliated team simply reports an empty `school_name`, which
maps the same way (`organization=""`, `org_type="unknown"`) — both
sources land in the same "never group" bucket `merge.py` checks
(`Team.organization == ""`), with no TBA-specific case in `merge.py`
itself.

**Why `teams.merge.merge_teams()` groups by `Team.organization ==
""` rather than a set of known sentinel values.** `merge.py` has no
knowledge of `"Family/Community"` or any other source-specific
sentinel — `_org_key()` only ever checks `if not team.organization`.
Each source is responsible for mapping its own "no real organization"
signal to an empty `Team.organization` at extraction time (see the
paragraph above); `merge.py` only needs to know that "empty" means
"never group," which keeps it source-agnostic and means a third future
source (e.g. increment 5's FLL static roster) needs no `merge.py`
change to get the same protection, only its own extraction-time
mapping to `organization=""` where appropriate.

**Confirmed true in practice (sprint 012).** `sources/static_roster.py`
needed zero `merge.py` changes to ship. 28 of the FLL roster's 48
records are family/home teams with no sponsoring school — the roster's
own upstream data marks these distinctly from its 20 school-affiliated
records, and `static_roster.py` maps that distinction to
`organization=""`/`org_type="family_community"` the same way
`sources/ftcscout.py` maps its `"Family/Community"` sentinel, landing
in the identical "never group" bucket with no FLL-specific case
anywhere in `merge.py`.

**Why `location_precision` defaults to `"none"` here rather than
`"city"`.** FTCScout does give city-level data, so it might seem
`"city"` is more accurate. `location_precision` is reserved for what
`teams/geo.py`'s seven-rung offline ladder (ticket 011-004) actually
resolved — school match, ZIP centroid, city centroid, or nothing.
Stamping `"city"` here, before that ladder has run at all, would be a
false claim about *how* the location was resolved, not just *that* a
city string exists. `Team.city` already carries the raw (cleaned)
place name for anything downstream that wants it before geocoding
runs; `location_precision` is reserved for geocoding provenance
specifically.

**Why FTCScout/TBA share no extraction code beyond the `TeamSource`
protocol shape.** The two payloads are structurally unrelated
(FTCScout: REST search, thin fields; TBA: `/api/v3/teams/{page}`,
richer fields, `X-TBA-Auth-Key` header) — forcing a shared extraction
helper would couple two things that change for unrelated reasons.
`sources/base.py` supplies only the shared protocol shape
(`discover`/`fetch`/`extract` → `Team` objects) and a generic
`run()` chaining helper, matching `adapters.base.Adapter`/
`adapters.base.run()`'s shape closely enough to reuse the mental
model, deliberately not the type itself (see Constraints). Confirmed
true in practice, not just anticipated: `sources/tba.py` (this ticket)
shares zero helper functions with `sources/ftcscout.py` — only the
`TeamSource` protocol and `SOURCE_NAME`/`LEAGUE`/`PROGRAM` naming
convention.

**Why `teams.pipeline._TEAM_SOURCES` is a private local dict, not a
second `adapters.base.ADAPTERS`.** `sources.base.run()` deliberately
takes its `TeamSource` as an explicit argument rather than resolving
one from a shared table (see `sources/base.py`'s own docstring) — the
*caller* still needs some way to pick a `TeamSource` per Team Registry
entry's `adapter_type`, and `teams.pipeline` is that one caller.
`_TEAM_SOURCES` is not exported, not imported by anything else, and
provides no path from `partner_scrape.pipeline.run()` into this
subsystem — it is a plain lookup local to one function, not a
public, growable extension point like `ADAPTERS` is. This ticket adds
a `"tba"` entry here, and nothing else changed about the shape of
`_TEAM_SOURCES` itself.

**Why `teams.export.export_teams()` performs no current/upcoming
filter or slug-dedup pass, unlike `export/writer.py`.** Teams are
undated (no filter possible or needed) and `team_id` is already
globally unique by construction (`f"{league.lower()}-{number}"`, set
at extraction time) — both of `export/writer.py`'s extra passes exist
to solve problems `Team` structurally doesn't have. What *is* reused
is the same "serialize exactly the published field set, write, done"
shape, via `TEAMS_SCHEMA_FIELDS`'s drift-proof `dataclasses.fields()`
derivation.

**Why `--source` on the `teams` subcommand filters by `adapter_type`,
not by Team Registry file stem.** `pipeline.run()`'s own `--source`
flag matches a Source Registry file's stem (e.g. `coastalrootsfarm`),
because that pipeline's registry holds one file per organization.
`teams`' registry instead holds one file per *league/program* source
(`ftc-sd.toml`, `frc-sd.toml`), and the operator-facing need is "run
only FTCScout" / "run only TBA" (e.g. to isolate a TBA outage) — a
property of *which acquisition method*, not which file. Filtering on
`SourceConfig.adapter_type` (`"ftcscout"`, `"tba"`) matches that need
directly.

**Why `teams.geo`'s seven rungs are ordered exact-cheapest-first, not
best-effort-in-parallel (this ticket).** `SchoolIndex._run_ladder()`
tries overrides, then an exact normalized-name match, before ever
computing a single Jaccard score — cheaper and strictly
higher-confidence checks should never be skipped in favor of a fuzzy
one that happens to run first. Rungs 3 (within-city, ≥0.60) and 4
(county-wide, ≥0.80) are two different *candidate pools* at two
different thresholds, not two different scoring functions — the same
`_best_token_match()` helper powers both, called once with a city
filter and once without. This mirrors the issue's own measured
methodology (Jaccard token-set matching, city-scoped before
county-wide) rather than the earlier difflib-ratio approach an even
earlier exploratory pass of the same issue tried and superseded.

**Why `geo.normalize_school_name()` is a separate function from
`normalize.partners.normalize_org_name()`, not a shared one (per
sprint.md's Design Rationale and this module's own docstring).** The
two solve different problems: `normalize_org_name` matches a scraped
organization string against the curated partner directory (drops a
leading "the ", nothing else); `normalize_school_name` matches a
team's self-reported school name against an *official government
directory's* naming conventions specifically — parenthetical asides
CDE writes into names (`"Feaster (Mae L.) Charter"`), and a small
institution-type stopword set (`"school"`, `"schools"`, `"sch"`,
`"the"`) that CDE systematically omits from its own records
(`"Poway High"`, never `"Poway High School"`). Importing
`normalize_org_name` and extending it in place would couple two
independently-changing concerns (partner-name matching, school-name
matching) into one function neither caller fully owns; keeping them
separate, even with a few lines of real duplication (both drop a
leading "the"), was the deliberate choice sprint.md's plan called for.

**Why the offline data provisioning script lives in `dev/`, not inside
`teams/` itself.** `dev/refresh_school_directories.py` is the only
thing in this whole subsystem that touches the network, and it is a
human-run, reviewed-before-commit tool (download, diff, commit) — not
part of any runtime code path. Placing it under `dev/` (matching this
project's existing convention: `dev/fetch_tec_api.py`,
`dev/export_site.py`, ...) rather than `teams/` makes that boundary
visible in the directory layout itself, not just in a docstring.

**Why city-precision teams render as one labelled badge per city, not
individual pins, jittered dots, or a plain cluster marker (this
ticket).** ~70 of the original 211-team fixture corpus sat at
`location_precision: "city"` (73 of the real, live 230-team corpus as
of ticket 011-003's reopening — see Orientation), and
most collapse onto the same handful of city centroids — plotting each
as its own `circleMarker` would stack dozens of markers on one point
and read, visually, as a single team. Three alternatives were rejected
explicitly: jittering (adding a random offset) fabricates precision
`teams.geo` never claimed and would shift on every regeneration, since
nothing anchors the jitter to a stable seed; a plain unlabeled cluster
marker (e.g. a generic clustering plugin) implies the cluster's
centroid itself means something, which it does not — it is a city
centroid, not a computed cluster center; a single stacked pin
misrepresents 62 real teams as one. `teams/index.astro`'s map script
instead groups every visible, in-region, city-precision card by
`data-city` and renders one `L.divIcon` per city carrying a visible
text label (`"San Diego — 40 teams"`) whose popup opens a `<ul>` list
of that city's teams, rather than a single team's popup — the same
distinction SUC-004's acceptance criteria draw. school/zip-precision
teams (a real resolved coordinate) keep the existing `circleMarker`
pin, unchanged from every other map on this site.

**Why teams with `in_region: false` are excluded from the map
entirely, not merely filterable (this ticket).** The ticket's own
instructions left this an explicit decision to make and record.
`Team.in_region` is not redundant with the map's own San Diego bounding
box: measured live, one out-of-region team (`ftc-9902`, city-precision
"San Clemente") has a city centroid that falls *inside* `SD_BOUNDS`
(`lat` 33.449, within the box's `latMax` 33.5), so the bounding-box
check alone would have silently plotted it as if it were a San Diego
County team. `teams/index.astro`'s map script checks
`card.dataset.region !== 'true'` before every other check, so an
out-of-region team is never plotted regardless of its coordinates —
this is a "San Diego teams" map, and a team flagged out-of-region by
`sources.ftcscout.OUT_OF_REGION_CITIES` should not silently contradict
that map's premise. Out-of-region teams are never removed from the
list/filter view, though (SUC-004's Error Flows precedent: flagged,
never dropped) — a "San Diego County Only" checkbox in `TeamFilters`
lets a visitor narrow the list to in-region teams if they want to, but
the default list shows everything, same as `teams.json` itself.

## 5. Interfaces

### Exposes
- **`model.Team`** — the record type: `team_id`, `league`, `program`,
  `number`, `name`, `organization`, `org_type`, `city`, `postal_code`,
  `latitude`, `longitude`, `location_precision`, `in_region`,
  `matched_name`, `needs_review` (this ticket), `website`,
  `website_status`, `organization_website`, `rookie_year`, `active`,
  `last_season`, `sponsors`, `org_key`, `sibling_team_ids`, `sources`.
  Every field defaults to an empty/neutral value; no `email` field
  exists (Constraints). Fields are populated incrementally across
  pipeline stages — `sources/ftcscout.py` and `sources/tba.py` set
  identity/organization/city/website/postal_code/sponsors/in-region
  fields; `teams.merge.merge_teams()` sets `org_key`/`sibling_team_ids`;
  `latitude`/`longitude`/`location_precision`/`organization_website`/
  `matched_name`/`needs_review` are set last, by this ticket's
  `teams.geo.geocode_teams()`.
- **`sources.base.TeamSource`** — the injectable per-source protocol
  (`discover(source, fetcher) -> Iterable[TeamRef]`,
  `fetch(ref, fetcher) -> RawTeamResponse`,
  `extract(raw, source) -> Iterable[Team]`), parallel in shape to
  `adapters.base.Adapter` but with no import relationship to it
  (Constraints).
- **`sources.base.run(source, team_source, fetcher) -> list[Team]`** —
  chains discover → fetch → extract for one `TeamSource`. Called by
  `teams.pipeline.run_teams()`, once per active Team Registry entry
  whose `adapter_type` has a registered `TeamSource`; there is no
  `teams`-side dispatch registry equivalent to `adapters.base.ADAPTERS`
  (see Design, "`_TEAM_SOURCES` is a private local dict").
- **`sources.ftcscout.FTCScoutSource`** — the concrete `TeamSource` for
  FTCScout's REST search endpoint. Config keys read from
  `SourceConfig.config`: `api_base` (default
  `https://api.ftcscout.org`), `region` (default `USCASD`).
- **`sources.tba.TBASource`** (this ticket) — the concrete `TeamSource`
  for The Blue Alliance's keyed v3 API. `discover()` probes `/api/v3/
  status` for `max_team_page`, then returns one `TeamRef` per `/api/v3/
  teams/{page}`; raises `RuntimeError` on any probe failure rather than
  degrading (Constraints). `extract()` filters each page to
  `_normalize_state(state_prov) == "CA"` (ticket 011-003, reopened —
  normalizes both TBA's `"CA"` and `"California"` forms, and any other
  recognized full US state name, to a USPS abbreviation before
  comparing; see Open Questions) and `city` in `SD_COUNTY_CITIES`.
  Config keys read from `SourceConfig.config`: `api_base` (default
  `config.get_tba_url()`). Auth via `config.get_tba_api_key()`, read
  fresh per call (`_auth_headers()`, matching `adapters/leaguesync.py`'s
  pattern).
- **`sources.static_roster.StaticRosterSource`** (sprint 012) — the
  concrete `TeamSource` for the committed FLL roster file. `discover()`
  returns a single `TeamRef` pointing at the roster path under
  `teams/data/` (read from `SourceConfig.config["roster_path"]`, no
  network URL); `fetch()` reads that file directly off disk, ignoring
  the `fetcher` argument (Constraints); `extract()` maps each roster row
  to a `Team` with `sources=["static_roster"]`, `league="FLL"`, and
  `organization=""`/`org_type="family_community"` for the 28 rows with
  no sponsoring school, mirroring `sources/ftcscout.py`'s sentinel
  mapping (Design). Never sets `latitude`/`longitude`/
  `location_precision` — like every other source, that is exclusively
  `teams.geo.geocode_teams()`'s job, run after this source the same way
  it runs after FTCScout/TBA.
- **`teams/registry/ftc-sd.toml`** / **`teams/registry/frc-sd.toml`** /
  **`teams/registry/fll-sd.toml`** (the last, sprint 012) — the
  FTCScout, TBA, and static-roster sources' `SourceConfig`s, loaded via
  `registry.loader.load_active_sources` pointed at `teams/registry/`
  (not the main `partner_scrape/registry/sources/` directory — a
  separate, disjoint registry namespace). `fll-sd.toml`'s `config` dict
  additionally carries `sunset_season = "2026-27"` (Constraints) — no
  `SourceConfig` schema change, since `config` is already free-form per
  `adapter_type` (`registry/schema.py`).
- **`merge.merge_teams(teams: list[Team]) -> list[Team]`** (this
  ticket) — sets `Team.org_key`/`sibling_team_ids` in place by grouping
  on `normalize.partners.normalize_org_name`-normalized
  `Team.organization`, skipping (never grouping) any team whose
  `organization` is empty. Mutates and returns the same list; called
  once by `teams.pipeline.run_teams()`, after every source has run and
  before `export_teams()`. See Constraints for the full identity rule
  and Design for why it keys on organization name, not team number.
- **`pipeline.run_teams(*, registry_dir=None, source=None, site_dir=None,
  fetcher=None, dry_run=False, geo_data_dir=None) -> dict`** — the
  programmatic entry point: loads the Team Registry (defaulting to the
  real seed, `teams/registry/`), dispatches each active source to its
  `TeamSource` via `_TEAM_SOURCES`, isolates any one source's failure
  (logged and skipped, matching `pipeline.run()`'s own SUC-008
  contract), links cross-league identity via `merge_teams()`, resolves
  every team's location via `teams.geo.geocode_teams()` (this ticket;
  `geo_data_dir` overrides the geocoding data directory, mainly for
  tests) over the combined result, and hands it to `export_teams()`.
  Returns that call's `{"meta": ..., "teams": [...]}` payload unchanged.
- **`teams.geo.geocode_teams(teams, *, data_dir=None) -> list[Team]`**
  (this ticket) — resolves every `Team` through the seven-rung offline
  ladder in place; returns the same list (parallel in shape to
  `merge_teams()`). `data_dir` defaults to `geo.DEFAULT_DATA_DIR` (the
  real committed `teams/data/`). Called once by `run_teams()`, after
  `merge_teams()` and before `export_teams()`.
- **`teams.geo.SchoolIndex(data_dir=None)`** (this ticket) — loads all
  five `teams/data/` files once and exposes `resolve(team)` (the full
  ladder for one `Team`, mutating it in place), `resolve_school(org,
  city)` (rungs 1-4, cached), `resolve_zip(postal_code)`/
  `resolve_city(city)` (rungs 5-6, uncached — already O(1) dict
  lookups), and `match_calls` (a counter of actual, uncached rungs-1-4
  ladder runs — what `tests/teams/test_geo.py`'s per-school-caching
  tests assert against). Raises `RuntimeError` if any data file under
  `data_dir` is missing or malformed — fails loudly at construction,
  per SUC-003's Error Flows ("a bad geocoding table is a build-time
  defect"). See Constraints for the caching design and Design for the
  rung ordering.
- **`teams.geo.normalize_school_name(name) -> str` /
  `normalize_city_name(city) -> str`** (this ticket) — the two
  normalizers `SchoolIndex` matches against; see Design for why these
  are separate from `normalize.partners.normalize_org_name`.
- **`export.export_teams(teams, site_dir=None, *, dry_run=False) -> dict`**
  — writes `{site_dir}/src/data/teams.json` as
  `{"meta": {...}, "teams": [...]}`. `meta` carries `generated`
  (timestamp), `total`, `by_league`, `out_of_region`, and
  `by_location_precision` — coverage/data-quality made visible in the
  artifact itself, not just a log line. `TEAMS_SCHEMA_FIELDS` (every
  `Team` field except `sources`) is the published field set, derived
  from `dataclasses.fields(Team)` so it can never drift — `org_key`/
  `sibling_team_ids` (this ticket) needed no `export.py` change to
  start being published, exactly as designed. Raises `RuntimeError` on
  an unwritable `site_dir`/`src/data`, matching `export_opportunities`'s
  loud-failure contract; `dry_run=True` computes and returns the
  payload without touching disk. **Never** writes or touches
  `opportunities.json`/`scrape-meta.json` (Constraints).
- **`partner-scrape teams [--dry-run] [--source ftcscout|tba]
  [--site-dir DIR] [--no-mirror] [-v]`** (`cli.py`) — the CLI entry
  point. Constructs a real `PoliteFetcher()` and calls `run_teams()`;
  unless `--dry-run`/`--no-mirror`, also calls `export.mirror_site_data`
  (reused, unmodified) against `config.get_mirror_site_dirs()`. Never
  calls `run`/`pipeline.run()` — see `cli.py`'s own module docstring
  and Constraints above.
- **`export/mirror.py`'s `MIRRORED_DATA_FILES`** — gained one entry,
  `"teams.json"`, in ticket 011-002; no change in this ticket. See
  `export/DESIGN.md`.
- **`teams/data/*`** (this ticket) — the five committed offline
  geocoding data files `teams.geo.SchoolIndex` reads:
  `sd-schools-public.tsv` (CDE public schools, San Diego County,
  `StatusType == "Active"`, `Virtual not in {"F","V"}`, 795 rows as of
  this ticket's build), `sd-schools-private.tsv` (NCES EDGE private
  schools, San Diego County, union of the 2021-22 and 2023-24 survey
  vintages, 213 rows), `zip-centroids.toml` (95 ZIP Code Tabulation
  Area centroids from the Census Bureau's own Gazetteer),
  `city-centroids.toml` (54 city/neighborhood centroids, derived from
  `sd-schools-public.tsv`'s own coordinates plus a documented ZIP
  fallback for the handful of San Diego neighborhoods CDE's `City`
  field does not distinguish from plain "San Diego" — see
  `dev/refresh_school_directories.py`'s own docstring), and
  `school-overrides.toml` (hand corrections, empty as of this ticket —
  the ladder's algorithmic rungs resolved the real corpus well enough
  that none has been needed yet, whether measured against the original
  211-team fixture or the real, live 230-team corpus ticket 011-003's
  reopening confirmed). All five are plain data, never imported as
  Python.
- **`dev/refresh_school_directories.py`** (this ticket) — the
  standalone, human-run yearly refresh script that produces the four
  generated files above (not `school-overrides.toml`, which is
  hand-maintained only). The only network-capable code in this whole
  subsystem; never imported by `teams.geo` or `teams.pipeline`. See its
  own module docstring for the exact CDE/NCES/Census Gazetteer
  endpoints and filtering rules.
- **Site Presentation Layer** (ticket 011-005) — the browsable `/teams`
  section, entirely in `site/src/`, entirely a read-only consumer of
  `teams.json` (no code here writes back into this subsystem):
  - `site/src/components/TeamCard.astro` — one team's summary card.
    Title anchor nested inside `<h3>` (`<h3><a href={...}>{title}</a></h3>`),
    matching `OpportunityCard.astro`, not `PartnerCard.astro` (see
    Design Rationale for why this matters to the map). Every card
    carries `data-type` (`Team.league`), `data-orgtype`
    (`Team.org_type`), `data-region` (`Team.in_region`), `data-precision`
    (`Team.location_precision`), `data-city`, `data-lat`/`data-lng`, and
    `data-title`/`data-desc` for `scripts/filters.js`'s search.
  - `site/src/components/TeamFilters.astro` — League and Organization
    Type facets (build-time counted via the same `tally()` shape
    `OpportunityFilters.astro` uses) plus a search box and a "San Diego
    County Only" toggle bound to `data-region`.
  - `site/src/pages/teams/index.astro` — the `/teams` index: List/Map
    toggle (no Calendar view — `Team` has no date field, the same real
    difference that makes Partner's simpler two-view toggle the closer
    analog than Opportunity's three-view one here). The map is the one
    piece of real new logic — see the city-badge Design Rationale entry
    above.
  - `site/src/pages/teams/[slug].astro` — one team's detail page.
    `getStaticPaths()` returns one path per `Team.team_id` (already the
    collision-free slug — `f"{league.lower()}-{number}"`, set at
    extraction time — so no separate slug field or slugify step was
    needed). Shows a mini-map with a location-precision caption
    ("Approximate (city center)", etc.) when the team has coordinates,
    and links to any `sibling_team_ids` (e.g. a school's FTC and FRC
    teams, or two FTC teams from the same school).
  - `Header.astro` / `Footer.astro` — "Teams" added to both hard-coded
    nav lists (Header's primary nav and Footer's "Explore" group) —
    they are two separate lists, not shared data, so both needed their
    own edit.
  - Every URL these pages emit goes through the same
    `const base = import.meta.env.BASE_URL.replace(/\/+$/, '')`
    convention every existing page uses.

### Consumes
- **`registry.schema.SourceConfig` / `registry.loader.load_active_sources`
  (from `registry/`)** — reused verbatim for per-league source config;
  no new schema. See `registry/DESIGN.md`.
- **`normalize.partners.normalize_org_name` (from `normalize/`)** (this
  ticket) — `teams.merge`'s only edge into `normalize/`, read-only:
  organization-name normalization for cross-league linking, reused
  directly rather than reimplemented. This is a *new* caller of an
  *existing* function, not a new dependency on `normalize/run()` or any
  other part of that pipeline — `teams/` still has no edge into
  `enrich/`, `normalize.run()`, `pipeline.run()`, or either existing
  export writer (sprint.md's Impact on Existing Components). See
  `normalize/DESIGN.md`.
- **`fetch.Fetcher` (from `fetch/`)** — the protocol every `TeamSource`
  method takes as an explicit argument. Production wiring to a real
  `fetch.PoliteFetcher` instance happens in `cli.py`'s `_run_teams()`
  handler, passed through `teams.pipeline.run_teams()`'s `fetcher`
  parameter — nothing in `teams/sources/` or `teams/pipeline.py`
  constructs a concrete fetcher's default itself except that one CLI
  call site, matching `adapters/leaguesync.py`'s convention of taking
  `Fetcher` as a parameter. See `fetch/DESIGN.md`.
- **`config.get_site_dir()` / `config.get_mirror_site_dirs()` /
  `config.get_tba_api_key()` / `config.get_tba_url()` (from
  `config.py`)** — the last two, this ticket, mirror
  `get_leaguesync_api_key()`/`get_leaguesync_url()` line-for-line,
  including the SOPS-decrypted-secret quote-stripping; `config.py`
  remains the only module reading `os.environ`. The site-dir/mirror
  accessors are ticket 011-002's, reused unmodified. See the root
  `partner_scrape/DESIGN.md`.
- **`export.mirror_site_data` (from `export/`)** — reused, unmodified,
  to propagate `teams.json` into extra checkouts. See `export/DESIGN.md`.

## 6. Open Questions / Known Limitations

- **(Sprint 012) The FLL successor program, if any, is unknown.** LEGO
  declined to renew its 28-year FIRST partnership on 2026-03-19, making
  2026-27 FLL's last season; `fll-sd.toml`'s `sunset_season` makes that
  loud (Constraints) rather than silent, but this subsystem has no way
  to react to whatever replaces FLL until a successor program actually
  exists with a name, data source, and roster shape — not something to
  speculatively build against now.
- **(Sprint 012) Pre-close verification requirement, carried forward
  directly from the ticket 011-003 lesson.** That defect shipped because
  a hand-authored test fixture (`"CA"` on every record) didn't match
  what TBA's real API actually returned (`"California"` on the
  majority), and was only caught by running the real pipeline during
  sprint validation, not by the fixture-based test suite. The FLL static
  roster is likewise a new external-data source this subsystem has never
  ingested before; its fixture must be a direct excerpt of the real
  committed roster file's rows (not a hand-authored approximation), and
  before this sprint closes, a real `partner-scrape teams --dry-run -v`
  run against the live registry (not fixtures) must confirm 278 teams
  overall and `meta.by_league["FLL"] == 48` — see `sprint.md`'s Test
  Strategy for the exact command. Recorded here as a standing
  reminder for whoever verifies this sprint before close, not just in
  the sprint document, since this file is where the ticket-011-003
  lesson itself was already recorded.
- **RESOLVED (ticket 011-003, reopened 2026-08-28) — a live
  `partner-scrape teams` run during ticket 011-005's work returned
  only 19 of the expected ~59 FRC teams (171 total, not 211); this was
  a real defect, not network conditions on one particular day.** Root
  cause: `sources.tba._extract_one()`'s filter compared TBA's raw
  `state_prov` field to the literal string `"CA"` with no
  normalization. Confirmed live: TBA reports the *full* state name
  (`"California"`) for the majority of San Diego County FRC records
  (59 of the real 78) and only the bare USPS abbreviation (`"CA"`) for
  the rest (19) — the original filter matched only the minority 19 and
  silently dropped the majority 59, with no error or warning logged
  (`TBASource` completed without raising; it just quietly under-filtered).
  Ticket 011-003's original test fixture was hand-authored with
  `"CA"` on every record, so this was never caught in tests — the
  fixture didn't match reality. **Fix:** `sources.tba._normalize_state()`
  maps any recognized full US state name to its USPS abbreviation
  before the comparison runs. **On the 19 `"CA"`-abbreviated records:**
  confirmed real, legitimate historical San Diego County FRC teams
  (verified against `/team/frcNNNN/years_participated`), just
  disproportionately old/inactive (all 19 last competed in or before
  2014) compared to the "California"-labeled 59 (40 of which last
  competed 2023 or later) — TBA's roster has no "active" flag and
  neither source populates `model.Team.active`, so age is not grounds
  to exclude them; both groups are included. **Corrected total,
  confirmed via a real `partner-scrape teams --dry-run` run
  (2026-08-28): 78 FRC, 230 overall (152 FTC + 78 FRC)**, with
  `by_location_precision` `{"school": 120 (79 FTC + 41 FRC), "zip": 33
  (all FRC), "city": 73 (69 FTC + 4 FRC), "none": 4 (all FTC — the same
  two Ensenada teams plus "San Antonio"/"Louisville", unaffected by
  this fix)}` and 13 `needs_review`. The committed fixture corpus was
  rebuilt from real, live-captured TBA records (not all 78 -- see
  `tests/teams/test_sources_tba.py`'s module docstring for the smaller,
  curated 7-record subset actually committed) and is now 159 teams
  (152 FTC + 7 FRC); every count elsewhere in this document citing
  "211"/"59"/"129" describes the now-superseded original fixture
  unless marked otherwise (see Orientation).
- **`school-overrides.toml` ships empty.** The algorithmic rungs (exact
  match + the stopword-normalized Jaccard fuzzy tiers) resolved the
  real corpus well enough that no hand correction was needed — measured
  129 school-precision/14 `needs_review` against the original 211-team
  fixture at ticket 011-004's build, and 120 school-precision/13
  `needs_review` against the real, live 230-team corpus at ticket
  011-003's reopening (see the bullet above) — and none of those flagged
  matches were bad enough to warrant a hand override rather than just a
  flag (each is a real, explainable wording difference — "Senior" vs.
  not, "HS" vs. spelled out, or the genuinely-ambiguous "Classical
  Academy Online" case). Future refreshes or a larger corpus (FLL, a
  follow-on sprint) may
  surface real residue; add entries there once a human has verified a
  specific coordinate, per that file's own header comment.
- **Two ambiguous out-of-region city names are deliberately
  unresolved.** FTCScout's `region=USCASD` search returned one team
  each reporting `city == "San Antonio"` and `city == "Louisville"` —
  real US place names that exist in many states, with no way to tell
  which one FTCScout means from the data available. `city-
  centroids.toml` has no entry for either, so both fall through to
  `location_precision: "none"` rather than guessing a specific city
  (Texas? California? Kentucky?). `"Ensenada"` (Mexico) is similarly
  unresolved — outside US Census/CDE coverage entirely, not a matcher
  gap. All three are in `sources.ftcscout.OUT_OF_REGION_CITIES`, so
  they are correctly flagged `in_region = False` regardless of
  location precision. See `dev/refresh_school_directories.py`'s
  docstring for the same reasoning applied to `city-centroids.toml`'s
  construction.
- **`Team.organization_website` is populated from CDE's `WebSite`
  column on a school-precision *public*-school match only** — NCES's
  private-school geocode data carries no website field at all, so a
  private-school match never sets it (confirmed: 88 of the 117
  school-precision FTC teams and 11 of the 44 FRC ones got a real
  `organization_website` at this ticket's build; the private-school
  gap accounts for the rest). Not a gap in the matcher — there is
  simply nothing to carry over from that source.
- **The ZIP/city centroid tables cover what this ticket's real corpus
  (211-team fixture at ticket 011-004's build; 230-team live corpus as
  of ticket 011-003's reopening) and `sources.tba.SD_COUNTY_CITIES`'s
  full allowlist need, not a hand-picked "~38"/"~25" count the issue's
  early estimate mentioned.** `dev/refresh_school_directories.py` derives 95 ZIP
  centroids (every ZIP appearing in `sd-schools-public.tsv`, a
  reproducible superset rather than a curated subset) and 54 city
  centroids (every CDE `City` value plus the documented neighborhood/
  out-of-region additions) — broader coverage costs nothing at runtime
  (an unused entry is simply never looked up) and reduces the chance a
  future real team falls through to a coarser rung than it should.
- `teams.pipeline.run_teams()`'s per-source failure isolation (logged
  and skipped) is now load-bearing in production, not just tested via
  a synthetic double: `sources.tba.TBASource.discover()` raises on a
  missing/invalid `TBA_KEY` or a non-200/401 `/api/v3/status` response
  by design (Constraints), and `tests/teams/test_pipeline.py`'s
  `TestTbaFailureIsolation` exercises both cases end-to-end. This is
  the real mechanism `TBA_KEY` not yet being in GitHub Actions repo
  secrets (sprint.md's Migration Concerns) depends on until an operator
  pushes it.
- `sources.ftcscout.OUT_OF_REGION_CITIES` is a small hand-maintained
  denylist derived from one live measurement (2026-08-27).
  `sources.tba.SD_COUNTY_CITIES` is the equivalent allowlist for TBA —
  see Constraints for why TBA needs an allowlist where FTCScout needs
  only a denylist. Both remain in place, unsuperseded: `teams.geo`'s
  CDE/NCES-driven ladder resolves *where* a team is, but `in_region`
  (whether it counts as San Diego County at all) is still these two
  lists' job — `geo.py` never sets or reads `in_region` (Constraints).
- `sources.tba.SD_COUNTY_CITIES` was originally assembled from this
  project's own historical FRC roster (`data/robot-teams.json`) plus
  every incorporated San Diego County city, not from a live capture of
  TBA's current data (no network access during ticket 011-003's
  original build). Ticket 011-003's reopening (2026-08-28) did perform
  a full live capture of all 24 TBA team pages (9,163 records) as part
  of diagnosing the `state_prov` defect above, and cross-checked every
  San Diego County match against this allowlist — no city was found
  missing (every one of the real 78 matches an existing entry), so this
  list is now empirically validated against live data, not just
  assembled from secondary sources. A San Diego city genuinely present
  in TBA's live data but missing from this list would still silently
  undercount if TBA's roster changes in the future; `meta.by_league
  ["FRC"]` reading below the measured 78 on a real run is the signal to
  check this list first.
- `FTCScoutSource.fetch()` does not send any auth header (FTCScout
  needs none) — unlike `adapters/leaguesync.py`'s Bearer-token pattern
  and unlike this ticket's `TBASource.fetch()`, which does.
- `teams.merge.merge_teams()` links strictly pairwise-by-group; unlike
  `teams.geo`'s fuzzy school matching (`needs_review: true` below a
  0.85 Jaccard score, this ticket), it has no notion of merge
  *confidence* at all — `merge.py` only ever compares exact normalized
  organization names, never fuzzy-matches two differently-worded
  organization strings. Two organizations whose names normalize
  identically but are not actually the same real-world organization
  (not observed in the 152+78 real live corpus confirmed at ticket
  011-003's reopening, but not structurally impossible) would link —
  there is no
  manual-override mechanism (a `school-overrides.toml`-style table) for
  `merge.py` today.
- Whether `teams.json` is ever joined to the curated partner directory,
  and whether LLM-assisted website discovery is added later, are both
  explicitly out of scope for the whole sprint, not just this ticket —
  see `sprint.md`'s Design Rationale and Scope.
