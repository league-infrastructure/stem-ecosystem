## 1. Purpose

`enrich/` is the LLM layer: it recovers fields the deterministic extractors could not
find, assigns controlled-vocabulary classifications, and decides whether an event is
relevant to the site's audience at all. It is a subsystem because it is the one place
where a non-deterministic, paid, network-bound, failure-prone external service enters the
pipeline — and that requires its own cost-control cache, its own failure policy, and its
own injectable seam. It owns the *relevance gate*: the judgment that a scraped record is
not a STEM learning opportunity for *any* audience and should not ship. Nothing else
makes that call.

**(Sprint 014)** The gate's audience scope widened from K-12-only to all ages —
matching the site's own "learners of all ages" framing and its existing `Adult`
age-facet — while noise rejection (non-STEM recreation, galas, closure notices,
nav pages) is unchanged. See §2's cache-versioning addition and §6's Open
Questions for how ~9,700 pre-existing cache entries, written under the old
K-12-only framing, get exactly one forced re-evaluation each.

**(Sprint 015, ticket 006, issue 27)** `_OPPORTUNITY_TYPE_VALUES` gains two
values, `"Camps"` and `"Competitions"` — additive only, the prior seven values
are unchanged — because 96% of records were landing in the generic
`"Out-of-school Programs"` bucket for lack of a more specific classification.
This is the same "prompt semantics changed" shape sprint 014 established:
`PROMPT_VERSION` bumps 1 → 2, forcing exactly one re-evaluation per
previously-cached `Event` via `cache.py`'s independent `prompt_version` check
(§3, §6). `normalize/taxonomy.py`'s keyword fallback gains a conservative
`"Camps"` rule but deliberately no `"Competitions"` rule — see that module's
own DESIGN.md addendum for the false-positive finding that decision rests on.
The site's `OpportunityFilters.astro` facet list (a hardcoded literal, not
derived from `opportunities.json`) needs the same two values added by hand;
done in this repo's `site/` checkout by this ticket. The sibling
`../stem-ecosystem` repo carries an identical hardcoded facet list in its own
copy of that component and needs the same one-line edit on its own schedule —
out of this ticket's write scope (a different repository).

**(Sprint 027)** The pass-1 bypass (§2, §3) generalizes from a single hardcoded
`event.kind == "internship"` check to `event.kind in model.PROGRAM_EXTRACTION_KINDS`
(`{"internship", "program"}`) — a `kind="program"` `Event`, emitted by the new
program-page extraction adapters (`adapters/DESIGN.md`), gets exactly the same
zero-cost, zero-mutation skip an internship already gets. No other behavior in this
module changes: the relevance-gate exemption below (`event.trusted`) is untouched and,
for a bypassed `program`/`internship` `Event`, is simply never reached (the bypass
happens before the gate runs at all).

## 2. Orientation

Three modules, layered:

- `llm_client.py` — the injectable `LLMClient` Protocol (`enrich_event(event) ->
  EnrichmentResult`), the `EnrichmentResult` dataclass, the real `AnthropicLLMClient`
  (model `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`), and `FixtureLLMClient` for tests. The request's
  JSON output schema is *generated from `EnrichmentResult`'s own dataclass annotations*
  by `_build_enrichment_json_schema()`, so the schema and the parser cannot drift apart.
- `cache.py` — `EnrichmentCache`, keyed by `Event.identity_key()`, one JSON file per
  event under `{SCRAPE_CACHE_DIR}/enrichment_cache/`, storing
  `(schema_version, prompt_version, content_hash, EnrichmentResult, enriched_at)`.
  `schema_version` (sprint 009) is a small integer bumped whenever `EnrichmentResult`'s
  *shape* changes; a stored entry whose version doesn't match `_CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION` is
  treated as a miss, the same as a `content_hash` mismatch — see Constraints below.
  `prompt_version` (sprint 014) is a second, independent small integer — imported from
  `llm_client.PROMPT_VERSION` — bumped whenever `_SYSTEM_PROMPT`'s *semantics* change; a
  mismatch (including a pre-sprint-014 entry with no `prompt_version` key at all) is
  likewise treated as a miss. The two version fields answer different questions (is the
  stored *shape* current; is the stored *judgment* current under the current prompt) and
  are checked independently — see Design below.
- `enricher.py` — `LLMEnricher`, which satisfies `pipeline.Enricher` structurally and
  sequences everything.

`LLMEnricher.enrich(events)` runs in four passes:

1. **Sequential** over the input in order: `kind in PROGRAM_EXTRACTION_KINDS` events
   (sprint 027: `"internship"` or `"program"`; previously `"internship"` only) bypass
   everything; the rest get a cache lookup. Hits are applied immediately (no LLM call).
   Misses are collected.
2. **Concurrent**: every miss's `llm_client.enrich_event()` is submitted to a
   `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8)`.
3. **Sequential apply**, back on the main thread, iterating misses in their *original*
   order: apply the result via `Event.set(...)` and write the cache entry.
4. **Relevance gate** over the full input list in original order: drop
   `relevant=False` events unless `event.trusted`.

`EnrichmentResult` carries both recoverable fields (`start`, `end`, `all_day`,
`location`, `cost`, `registration_url`) and classification fields (`areas_of_interest`,
`age_grade_level`, `cost_range`, `time_of_day`, and, since sprint 009,
`opportunity_type`), plus `relevant` and `relevance_reason`. `opportunity_type` is always
produced, like the other classification fields, and — unlike `cost_range`'s "" for
unknown — is never empty: the prompt instructs the model to fall back to the general
`"Out-of-school Programs"` bucket when nothing more specific applies, matching
`normalize.taxonomy.classify_opportunity_type`'s existing default and giving the site a
real value to filter on rather than a blank field.

## 3. Constraints and Invariants

- **Fail open, always.** Any exception from the LLM call — not only `LLMEnrichmentError`,
  but network errors, malformed responses, anything — is logged as a warning and falls
  back to `normalize.taxonomy`'s keyword derivation with `relevant=True`. A record must
  never be dropped because the LLM was unavailable. Failing closed would silently empty
  the site during any API outage.
- **A failed call writes no cache entry.** Caching a degraded fallback would make the
  next run reuse it instead of retrying the LLM, turning a transient outage into
  permanent data loss for those records.
- **Cache writes are strictly single-threaded.** The on-disk layout is one JSON file per
  event; concurrent writers would race on the same path. Only the LLM calls themselves
  run concurrently — pass 2 above touches no shared mutable state beyond each future's own
  return value.
- **The returned list's order and membership must be identical to what a fully sequential
  implementation would produce.** Concurrency changes only how fast the calls happen.
  `max_workers=1` must behave exactly like the original sequential code. Any change that
  makes output depend on completion order breaks reproducibility of a run.
- **`kind in PROGRAM_EXTRACTION_KINDS` events bypass this subsystem entirely** — no cache
  lookup, no LLM call, no field mutation. An internship arrives already classified and
  gated deterministically by `adapters/ats_filters.py`; **(sprint 027)** a `program`-kind
  event arrives already classified by the new program-page LLM extraction call
  (`adapters/DESIGN.md`) — a different, dedicated call against a program-specific schema,
  not this module's generic recovery/classification prompt. Either way, this module's
  relevance prompt judges *learning opportunities* (events and programs) from
  partially-extracted, ambiguous source text; both bypassed kinds arrive already fully
  and deliberately classified by a more specific upstream process, so routing them
  through the generic prompt a second time would not just be redundant LLM spend — it
  would let a generic classification silently overwrite a more specific one via the same
  `Event.set()` field_provenance mechanism `normalize/`'s field_provenance-presence
  precedence otherwise relies on to prefer the *first* real classification, not the
  *last* one. (Before sprint 014 this bullet's stated risk was specifically that the old
  K-12-only framing would misjudge job-posting text as "adult-only" and drop it; that
  specific risk is moot now that the gate accepts any audience, but the bypass itself is
  unchanged and independently justified.)
- **`event.trusted` overrides the relevance gate.** First-party curated sources (the
  League's own classes via `adapters/leaguesync.py`) are still enriched and classified
  normally but must never be gate-dropped. Removing this makes the site's own operator
  subject to the classifier's judgment about the operator's own programs.
- **The content hash covers only *enrichable* fields** — exactly the fields
  `_build_user_prompt` reads. Hashing the whole `Event` would make the classification
  fields this cache itself writes back, and `field_provenance` bookkeeping, force
  spurious re-enrichment on every run. That is a direct, recurring dollar cost.
- **A cache entry's `schema_version` must match `_CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION` to count as a hit**
  (sprint 009). `content_hash` alone cannot catch an `EnrichmentResult` *output* shape
  change (adding `opportunity_type` doesn't touch any input field the hash covers), so
  without an explicit version an old entry would either silently omit the new field
  forever or fail to deserialize. A version mismatch (including a pre-sprint-009 entry
  with no `schema_version` key at all) is a miss, forcing exactly one re-enrichment per
  affected Event — real, one-time Anthropic spend proportional to the corpus, not a bug.
  See `sprint.md`'s Migration Concerns.
- **A cache entry's `prompt_version` must match `llm_client.PROMPT_VERSION` to count as a
  hit** (sprint 014). `content_hash` deliberately covers only an event's *input* fields
  (the bullet above), so it cannot and must not detect a change to the *prompt's own
  semantics* — widening the audience scope touches no field the hash reads. Without an
  explicit prompt version, every one of the ~9,700 pre-sprint-014 cache entries (written
  under the old K-12-only prompt) would stay a permanent, silent hit under the new prompt,
  and the gate change would never actually take effect for existing corpus. A mismatch
  (including a pre-sprint-014 entry with no `prompt_version` key) is a miss, forcing
  exactly one re-enrichment per affected Event, the same shape as the `schema_version`
  check but checked independently — bumping one must never imply or require bumping the
  other, since they answer unrelated questions (see Design below).
- **`llm_client.py` deliberately does not import `normalize/taxonomy.py`,** even though
  their controlled vocabularies overlap. Duplication is the accepted cost of keeping this
  module's only outward dependency the Anthropic API itself.
- **Every consumer depends on `LLMClient`, never on the `anthropic` SDK directly.**
- **One event's failure or gating never affects another in the same batch.** Each is
  handled independently, matching `pipeline.py`'s per-source isolation convention.

## 4. Design

**Why a new cache instead of reusing `fetch/`'s.** The fetch cache answers "what did this
URL return?"; this cache answers "have we already enriched this content?". Different key
(an `Event` identity, not a URL), different invalidation signal (content hash of
enrichable fields, not HTTP validators), different lifetime. It shards keys into
filesystem-safe filenames the same way `fetch/cache.py` does, because
`identity_key()` is a tuple whose `external_id` variant can contain characters unsafe in
a path.

**Why the schema is generated from the dataclass.** `_field_json_schema` walks
`EnrichmentResult`'s annotations to build the JSON schema sent to the API. The alternative
— a hand-maintained schema literal — drifts the moment a field is added, and the failure
mode is a silently unparsed response rather than an error. This is exactly why adding
`opportunity_type` (sprint 009) required no separate schema edit: it is picked up by
`_build_enrichment_json_schema()` automatically, the same way every prior classification
field was.

**Why a schema version, not just a bigger content hash.** The content hash's whole point
(the bullet above) is to answer "did the *input* change," so the cache can skip an
unnecessary LLM call. It deliberately does not — and must not — depend on
`EnrichmentResult`'s own shape, or every classification field this cache round-trips would
make the hash a moving target. A schema version is a separate, orthogonal signal: "is the
*stored value's shape* still what this code expects." Conflating the two (e.g. by hashing
the dataclass's field names into the content hash) would tie an unrelated concern
(input-change detection) to schema evolution, and would still need special-casing for the
very first version bump (nothing to compare against). An explicit integer, defaulting
absent-means-`0` treated as always-stale-for-current, is simpler and says exactly what it
means.

**Why `prompt_version` is a new, separate constant, not a reuse of
`_CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION`** (sprint 014). *Context:* the gate-widening change (issue 22)
needed some way to force re-evaluation of ~9,700 pre-existing cache entries whose stored
`relevant` verdict was computed under the old, narrower prompt. *Alternatives considered:*
bump `_CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION` instead of adding a new field — rejected. That constant's
entire documented purpose (§3 above, and its own module docstring) is answering "is the
*stored value's shape* still what this code expects," a question about `EnrichmentResult`'s
dataclass fields, orthogonal to whether the *judgment* those fields hold is still valid
under the current prompt. Conflating them would mean every future prompt tweak also has
to reason about whether it accidentally implies a schema change (and vice versa: a real
schema change would force an unrelated re-judgment of `relevant`, which happens to be
harmless today but is not a property the two concerns should share by construction).
*Why this choice:* a second, independently-checked version integer costs one more field
per cache entry and preserves the same "orthogonal signal" principle
`_CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION` itself was designed around (see the schema-version rationale
directly above this one) — extended, not violated, by this addition. *Consequences:* a
change that touches both `_SYSTEM_PROMPT`'s semantics and `EnrichmentResult`'s shape in
the same sprint bumps both constants and forces two independent miss checks that happen
to agree on the outcome for every entry; this has no different practical effect than one
combined check would, so the cost of keeping them separate is purely conceptual clarity,
paid once, here.

**Provenance stamping.** Applied results are written through `Event.set(field, value,
source, confidence)` with `source="llm_enrichment"`, `confidence=0.7`; the taxonomy
fallback uses `source="taxonomy_fallback"`, `confidence=0.3`. Both sit below the
structured-API adapters' 1.0 and the JSON-LD ladder rung's 1.0, so an LLM guess never
beats a publisher-authored value in `normalize/`'s merge selection. Only fields the
extractors left empty are recovered.

**Why concurrency was added, and only there.** A full corpus refresh was roughly 100
minutes of pure sequential LLM latency. The calls are independent and I/O-bound —
the textbook case for a bounded thread pool. Everything else (cache reads, cache writes,
result application, gating) stayed on the main thread, which is what preserves both the
ordering invariant and the single-writer cache guarantee.

**Enrichment defaults to on.** `cli.py` constructs
`LLMEnricher(AnthropicLLMClient(), EnrichmentCache())` unless `--no-enrich` is passed.
The flag is the escape hatch for local and dry-run work that must not incur API cost or
require a key.

**Credentials.** `AnthropicLLMClient` constructs `anthropic.Anthropic()` with no explicit
`api_key`; the SDK resolves `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` itself. This is deliberately not routed
through `config.py` — the SDK, not this package, is reading the environment.

## 5. Interfaces

### Exposes
- **`LLMEnricher(llm_client, cache, max_workers=8)`** with **`.enrich(events) ->
  list[Event]`** — satisfies `pipeline.Enricher` structurally. Mutates the input `Event`
  objects in place via `Event.set(...)` and returns the gated subset in original order.
  Never raises for an LLM failure.
- **`LLMClient` Protocol** — `enrich_event(event) -> EnrichmentResult`. The injectable
  seam.
- **`EnrichmentResult`** — recoverable fields, classification fields, `relevant`,
  `relevance_reason`.
- **`AnthropicLLMClient`** (production) and **`FixtureLLMClient`** (tests, canned
  responses keyed by a caller-supplied function, records `.calls`).
- **`EnrichmentCache(cache_dir=None, clock=...)`** with `.lookup(event)` / `.store(event,
  result)`.
- **`content_hash(event) -> str`** — the enrichable-fields hash, also reused verbatim by
  `store/event_store.py` so the two caches' notion of "content changed" cannot drift.
- **`ENRICHMENT_JSON_SCHEMA`, `MODEL_ID`, `LLM_SOURCE`, `LLM_CONFIDENCE`,
  `FALLBACK_SOURCE`, `FALLBACK_CONFIDENCE`, `LLMEnrichmentError`.**
- **`_CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION`** (sprint 009, `cache.py`) — the current stored-entry schema
  version; bumped whenever `EnrichmentResult`'s shape changes.
- **`PROMPT_VERSION`** (sprint 014, `llm_client.py`) — the current `_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
  semantic version; bumped whenever the prompt's judgment criteria change (e.g. the
  audience-scope widening this sprint makes). Read by `cache.py` as an independent
  cache-hit signal alongside `_CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION`.

### Consumes
- **`Event`, `Event.set`, `Event.identity_key` (from `model.py`)** — the record being
  enriched and the provenance mechanism. See the root `partner_scrape/DESIGN.md`.
- **`normalize.taxonomy` (from `normalize/`)** — keyword-rule derivation, used *only* as
  the fail-open fallback. See `normalize/DESIGN.md`.
- **`config.get_scrape_cache_dir()` (from `config.py`)** — cache location.
- **The `anthropic` SDK** — external, reached only from `AnthropicLLMClient`.

## 6. Open Questions / Known Limitations

- **(Sprint 014)** The gate-widening prompt change forces exactly one re-enrichment for
  every previously-cached `Event` — roughly 9,700 records at sprint start — via the new
  `prompt_version` check. This is a real, one-time Anthropic API cost, accepted as the
  direct price of correcting the K-12-only framing rather than avoided by any code
  mechanism; it is not covered by (and does not resolve) the pre-existing "no cost
  accounting or per-run call budget" limitation immediately below, which is about
  *ongoing*, unbounded growth, not this one-time, bounded, known-size event.
- **(Sprint 015, ticket 006)** The `"Camps"`/`"Competitions"` vocabulary widening's
  `PROMPT_VERSION` 1 → 2 bump is the same shape as sprint 014's 0 → 1 bump immediately
  above: one forced re-evaluation per previously-cached `Event`, real one-time Anthropic
  spend, accepted per that sprint's precedent. Unlike sprint 014's bump this one is not
  tied to a specific measured corpus size at time of writing.
- The fail-open policy means an API outage produces a full run of `taxonomy_fallback`
  classifications at confidence 0.3, exported with no visible marker on the site. The
  yield report shows counts, not classification quality.
- There is no cost accounting or per-run call budget. A registry growth spurt or a cache
  wipe means a proportionally larger bill with no guard rail.
- The enrichment cache has no eviction; entries for events that no longer exist persist
  indefinitely.
- `relevance_reason` is captured on the `Event` but is not exported anywhere and not
  surfaced in the yield report, so gate decisions are only reviewable by re-reading cache
  files.
- The model ID is a hard-coded constant. Model migration is a code change, not
  configuration.
- `_recoverable_fields` and the classification vocabularies are duplicated between this
  package and `normalize/taxonomy.py` by deliberate choice; if they drift, nothing
  detects it. Sprint 009 adds `opportunity_type` to this duplication (the LLM's controlled
  vocabulary in `llm_client.py` and `normalize.taxonomy.OPPORTUNITY_TYPE_KEYWORDS` must be
  read together to see the whole picture) — deliberately not unified, same rationale as
  every other duplicated vocabulary here, and deliberately *not* symmetric: the LLM's
  vocabulary includes `"Funding Opportunities"`, which the keyword fallback still does not
  produce (see `normalize/DESIGN.md`) because a keyword rule for it was already shown to
  false-positive on unrelated text.
- **(Sprint 027)** `PROGRAM_EXTRACTION_KINDS` is the explicit reuse surface named for
  sprints 029 (competitions) and 030 (educator programs): a future source registered
  with `program_kind = "program"` gets this module's full bypass with zero further
  change here. Nothing currently prevents a future sprint from registering a `program`
  kind whose content is *not* actually curated/pre-classified the way this sprint's
  program pages are (e.g. a lower-trust or partially-automated source) and silently
  losing the relevance gate and generic classification it might have needed — the
  bypass is keyed on `kind` alone, not on any independent trust signal. Not a problem
  for this sprint's own sources (each is a hand-registered, individually reviewed page
  or listing), but worth a future sprint re-checking before extending `kind="program"`
  to a less-curated source class.
