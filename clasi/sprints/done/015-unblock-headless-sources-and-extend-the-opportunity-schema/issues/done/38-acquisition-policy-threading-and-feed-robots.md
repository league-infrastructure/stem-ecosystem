# Thread acquisition_policy into the fetcher; decide robots policy for feed endpoints; populate Fleet event location

## Description

Three follow-ups from sprint 014 ticket 004's live registration work
(full evidence in that ticket's Notes section):

1. **`acquisition_policy` is dead config.** No adapter threads
   `acquisition_policy.respect_robots` / `rate_limit_seconds` from the
   source TOML into `PoliteFetcher.get()`'s per-call parameters —
   including `leaguesync.py`, which sets `respect_robots = false` to no
   effect. Fix: thread the per-source policy through the fetch path (or
   into fetcher construction per source) with fixture tests.
2. **Robots policy for published feed endpoints — STAKEHOLDER
   DECISION.** Five live, high-yield, well-formed feeds are currently
   blocked solely by host robots.txt: SD County Parks (Tockify ICS, 553
   events), San Diego Astronomy Association + Mission Trails Foundation
   + Surfrider SD (calendar.google.com ICS), SWE San Diego (existing
   partner with no other source). These are subscription URLs designed
   to be polled by calendar clients; robots.txt on tockify/gcal targets
   crawlers. Whether partner-scrape treats an explicitly-published ICS
   subscription URL as feed-client traffic (fetch, politely, ignoring
   robots for that URL class) or keeps strict robots compliance is a
   policy call for Eric — decide before enabling (1) for these sources.
   Registration TOMLs for all five are drafted in ticket 014-004's
   notes and were NOT committed.
3. **Fleet listing_html never populates `Event.location`**, which is
   exactly what blocked the measured Balboa Park ↔ Fleet cross-source
   dedup collapse ("Educator Open House" 2026-09-24 matched on
   title+date, failed on venue). Populate location in the Fleet adapter
   path (the venue is constant: 1875 El Prado) and re-measure the
   Balboa Park overlap.

Also worth re-probing when touched: navalstem.us (TEC valid, total=0
this window — seasonal), cafirst.org (no TEC REST despite plugin
markup — needs a different approach; issue 30 covers FIRST events),
California DI / Cabrillo NM Foundation (Squarespace per-event ICS only
— a small multi-URL ical enhancement would unlock both).

## Stakeholder decision (item 2) — RESOLVED 2026-08-30

Eric decided 2026-08-30 (recorded by team-lead, sprint 015): **treat
explicitly-published ICS subscription URLs as feed-client traffic.**
Poll them politely (existing rate limits apply) but ignore host
robots.txt for this URL class, matching what calendar clients
(Google Calendar, Outlook) do with the same URLs. Register all five
feeds — SD County Parks, Mission Trails Regional Park Foundation,
Surfrider SD, San Diego Astronomy Association, SWE San Diego — with
`acquisition_policy.respect_robots = false`. This clears ticket
015-005's gate check. The decision covers published subscription-feed
URLs only; strict robots compliance remains the default for every
other URL class.
