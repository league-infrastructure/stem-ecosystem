# stem-ecosystem fetch-data.sh bucket mode (cross-repo)

## Description

CROSS-REPO: this change is made in /Users/eric/proj/league/infrastructure/stem-ecosystem and committed in that repo, not partner-scrape.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `scripts/fetch-data.sh` gains a bucket source mode: `aws s3 sync s3://jtl-stem-ecosystem-scrape/data/` (sfo3 endpoint) into a temp dir, then the existing explicit copy list and image check run unchanged
- [x] Existing source mode behavior unchanged
- [x] Usage documented in the script header/README; deploy workflow stays manual
- [x] Verified: image check passes and `npm run build` succeeds against bucket data (needs credentials)

## Implementation Plan

Record the stem-ecosystem commit hash in this ticket.
See design/ticket-plan.md and architecture-update.md. Update affected DESIGN.md files.

## Testing

- **Existing tests to run**: `uv run pytest` (all offline)
- **New tests to write**: as listed in acceptance criteria
- **Verification command**: `uv run pytest`

## Result

- stem-ecosystem branch `partner-scrape-038-bucket-fetch`, commit `c05d50c` (not pushed, not merged).
- `scripts/fetch-data.sh --bucket` added; README "Where the data comes from" rewritten.
- Verified against the real bucket: image check passed (360 opportunities, 485 images, 485 referenced, 0 missing); `npm run build` built 925 pages. Regenerated data was restored, not committed.
