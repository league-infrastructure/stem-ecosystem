# Route data output through the data Store

## Description

Make every writer of published output use the data Store with unchanged keys.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Switched to `get_data_store()`: `export/writer.py`, `export/ads.py`, `export/publish.py`, `export/images.py`, `teams/export.py`, `directory/export.py`, `observability/snapshot.py`, `dev/backfill_missing_images.py`, and call sites in `pipeline.py`/`cli.py`
- [x] Keys are identical to today's `data/` layout; Content-Type `application/json` or `image/*`
- [x] `EventImageDownloader` takes a store plus the `images/opportunities/` prefix and skips the write when the key exists
- [x] `yield-history.json` is read back and saved through the Store
- [x] Docstrings/comments claiming data is committed to git are corrected
- [x] All tests use LocalStore/tmp_path and stay offline

## Implementation Plan

Files listed above plus tests.
See design/ticket-plan.md and architecture-update.md. Update affected DESIGN.md files.

## Testing

- **Existing tests to run**: `uv run pytest` (all offline)
- **New tests to write**: as listed in acceptance criteria
- **Verification command**: `uv run pytest`
