"""The Hub Registry schema: ``HubConfig`` and its TOML directory loader.

Structurally parallel to ``registry/schema.py`` + ``registry/loader.py``
(``SourceConfig``/``load_sources``), but deliberately kept in one module
rather than split across two -- a hub definition is a much smaller shape
than a ``SourceConfig`` (no ``adapter_type``, no ``acquisition_policy``),
so a schema/loader split adds no real separation of concerns here.

A ``HubConfig`` describes one curated external hub -- a regional
calendar, a library system's event listing, a university calendar --
purely as a *lead-generation* source: where to look
(``page_urls``), never how to acquire events from it directly. See
sprint.md's Architecture > Hub Registry and the Design Rationale
("Hub scanning is structurally separate from the Event/Opportunity
pipeline"): hub definitions live under a new ``registry/hubs/``
directory, physically separate from ``registry/sources/``, so
``registry/loader.py``'s ``DEFAULT_SOURCES_DIR`` scan never sees them
and can never accidentally treat a hub as a live source.

    convention ``SourceConfig.source_id`` uses.

    ``page_urls`` are absolute page URLs on the hub's own site to scan --
    a hub has no ``site_url`` field of its own; every entry in
    ``page_urls`` must already be absolute (unlike
    ``discovery/listing.py``'s ``source.config["listing_urls"]``, which
    resolves bare paths against a source's ``site_url``).

    CSS selector narrowing which part of the page to scan) -- Hub Scan
    (ticket 003's other module) does not read anything from it yet; it
    exists so a future hub with unusual page structure has somewhere to
