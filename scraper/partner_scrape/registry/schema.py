"""The Source Registry schema: ``SourceConfig`` and its TOML constructor.

A ``SourceConfig`` describes, in data, one organization and how to
reach its events -- the Registry's whole job (sprint.md Architecture >
Source Registry, SUC-001). ``config``, ``taxonomy_defaults``, and
``acquisition_policy`` are kept as plain ``dict``s rather than
further-typed sub-schemas: different ``adapter_type``s need different
shapes in ``config`` (e.g. ``api_base`` for ``tec_rest``, ``feed_url``
for ``ical``), and over-typing it now would need revisiting the moment
a fourth adapter type arrives.

#: Top-level TOML keys every source file must define. A file missing

_REQUIRED_FIELDS = ("org_name", "adapter_type", "config")

#: Default cap on how many ``EventRef``s a single source will fetch in
#: one run (``adapters/base.py``'s ``run()`` is the actual consumer --
#: it truncates ``discover()``'s output to this many refs, logging how
#: many were dropped, unless the source overrides it via
#: ``acquisition_policy.max_urls``). Public (unlike the private
#: ``_ACQUISITION_POLICY_DEFAULTS`` dict below) so ``adapters/base.py``
#: can import it directly as its own defensive fallback for a
#: directly-constructed ``SourceConfig`` (e.g. in tests) whose
#: ``acquisition_policy`` never went through :meth:`SourceConfig.from_toml`
#: and so was never merged with these defaults. 300 is generous headroom
#: over every real registered source's typical event-page count while
#: still bounding a pathological outlier (e.g. a sitemap-derived source
#: whose "event" sitemap is actually hundreds of unrelated blog posts)
#: from dominating a run's wall-clock time.

#: Defaults applied to ``acquisition_policy`` keys a source file omits.
#: Ticket 003 (Fetch & Cache) is the actual consumer of these values;
#: this module only owns supplying sane defaults so hand-authored TOML
#: files aren't required to repeat this boilerplate in every file.
#: ``fetch_strategy`` defaults to ``"static"`` -- ticket 005's Pipeline
#: reads this key (``source.acquisition_policy.get("fetch_strategy",
#: "static")``) to pick between the run's default ``Fetcher`` and a
#: lazily-constructed headless one (``"headless"``, ``fetch/headless.py``
#: ``PlaywrightFetcher``). Purely additive: every source TOML file
#: written before this key existed has no ``fetch_strategy`` line and
#: resolves to ``"static"`` here, identical to its pre-ticket-005 fetch
#: behavior -- see sprint.md's Migration Concerns.
#: ``max_urls`` defaults to :data:`DEFAULT_MAX_URLS_PER_SOURCE` -- see
#: its own docstring above.
