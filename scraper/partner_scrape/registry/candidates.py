"""Candidate Review Queue: persists discovered ``OrgCandidate``s as
review-marked TOML stubs for a human operator to promote.

See sprint.md's Architecture > Candidate Review Queue, SUC-001, and the
Design Rationale ("Hub scanning is structurally separate from the
Event/Opportunity pipeline"). A stub deliberately contains only
``org_name``, ``candidate_url``, ``discovered_via``, and
``evidence_text`` -- **no** ``adapter_type``/``config`` -- so that even a
misdirected attempt to load it via ``registry.loader.load_sources()``
fails ``SourceConfig.from_toml``'s required-field check
(``InvalidSourceConfig``) rather than silently succeeding. This is a
belt-and-suspenders defense: the primary safety property is that
``registry/candidates/`` is physically separate from
``registry/sources/`` and never in ``registry/loader.py``'s scan path
(that module is unmodified by this ticket) -- this stub shape is what
happens if a future caller ever points the loader at the wrong
directory anyway.
