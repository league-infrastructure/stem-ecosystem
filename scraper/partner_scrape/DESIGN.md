## 1. Purpose

`partner_scrape/` is the whole aggregator engine: the Python package that visits ~100 San
Diego STEM partner organizations, extracts their events, programs, and internships,
deduplicates and classifies them, and publishes a single JSON data contract into the
`stem-ecosystem` Astro site. This directory is the declared source root; everything the
engine does lives under it. Its ten subdirectories are the pipeline's stages and
supporting services, and the four modules at this level are the orchestration and shared
vocabulary that hold them together.

This document is the map of that root: what the top-level modules are, one line per
subsystem, and the conventions every subsystem doc below may assume without restating.

## 2. Orientation

**The run, end to end.** `pipeline.run()` sequences it:

```
registry.load_active_sources()
  → ThreadPoolExecutor(8) × [ adapters.run(source, fetcher) ]     per-source isolation
      where adapters.run = discover → fetch → extract             (discovery/, fetch/, extract/)
  → enrichers  (enrich.LLMEnricher: recover fields, classify (incl. opportunity_type), gate relevance)
  → normalize.run(events, partners.json, image_resolver)          collapse → dedup → map
  → export.export_opportunities(...) + export.export_ads(...) + export.partner_log.record(...)
```

`cli.py` then, after `run()` returns, calls `export.publish.project(...)` (collapses the
accumulated per-partner logs into the published `public/data/` tree — sprint 009), and
prints the yield report from `observability/`. The whole run touches the network only
through `fetch/`.

**Sprint 009 addition.** `export.partner_log.record(...)` is a new call inside
`pipeline.run()`, alongside the existing `export_opportunities`/`export_ads` calls: it
persists this run's `Opportunity`s into a durable, per-partner, append-only log (never
overwritten, unlike the flat `opportunities.json`). `export.publish.project(...)` is a new,
separate, CLI-sequenced step (called after `run()` returns, not inside it, since it needs
the finished, accumulated state) that reads *all* accumulated per-partner logs — not only
this run's — and projects them into the published `public/data/` contract. See
`export/DESIGN.md` for both.

**Sprint 011 addition — a second, sibling pipeline, not an extension of
the one above.** `partner_scrape/teams/` (new subsystem — see
`teams/DESIGN.md`) is invoked by its own CLI subcommand,
`partner-scrape teams`, calling `teams.pipeline.run_teams()`, which
sequences `teams.sources.{ftcscout,tba}` → `teams.merge` → `teams.geo`
→ `teams.export`. It is not called from `pipeline.run()` and does not
call it; it reuses `registry.schema/loader`, `fetch.PoliteFetcher`,
`config.py` (see the `config.py` bullet below), and one function of
`normalize.partners`, but has no edge into `adapters/`, `enrich/`,
`normalize.run()`, or either existing export writer. This is
deliberate, not an oversight: a `Team` is a standing entity with no
date, and `export/writer.py`'s current-and-upcoming filter would drop
every one of them if it were routed through `Opportunity`. See
`teams/DESIGN.md` for the full module breakdown.

**Root-level modules.**

- **`pipeline.py`** — the orchestrator. Loads active sources; runs each `static`-strategy
  source's discover→fetch→extract chain in a bounded `ThreadPoolExecutor` (default 8
  workers, or a plain sequential loop when `max_source_workers <= 1`); selects each
  source's `Fetcher` from its `acquisition_policy.fetch_strategy`, lazily constructing the
  headless one at most once per run; applies enrichers in order; normalizes; exports
  opportunities and ads. It defines two Protocols that other subsystems satisfy
  structurally without importing them — `Enricher` and `Reporter`. Its only real logic is
  sequencing, per-source `Fetcher` selection, and per-source error isolation.
  **(Sprint 014)** every `headless`-strategy source is now dispatched through a second,
  dedicated single-worker `ThreadPoolExecutor` rather than the main 8-worker one — see
  §4's new concurrency convention and `fetch/DESIGN.md`'s sprint 014 section for why a
  lock alone is not sufficient for `PlaywrightFetcher`.
- **`cli.py`** — the `partner-scrape` console script. `argparse` wrapper over
  `pipeline.run()`, plus the `discover-candidates` subcommand for the lead-generation
  flow. Constructs the default concrete implementations (`LLMEnricher` with
  `AnthropicLLMClient`, `YieldReporter`) and owns console output. No business decisions
  live here. **Sprint 011:** gains a `teams` subcommand (`partner-scrape teams [--dry-run]
  [--source ftcscout|tba] [--site-dir DIR] [-v]`), calling `teams.pipeline.run_teams()`.
  The existing `run`/`discover-candidates` subcommands are unchanged. **(Sprint 019)** the
  `--mirror-site-dir`/`--no-mirror` flags and the mirror step this bullet used to describe
  were removed outright — see `export/DESIGN.md`'s sprint 019 note.
- **`config.py`** — the only module in the package that reads `os.environ`. Accessors for
  `SCRAPE_CACHE_DIR`, `SITE_DIR` (default: CWD), `LEAGUESYNC_API_KEY`, and
  `LEAGUESYNC_URL`. Values are assembled by dotconfig into
  layered `.env` files before the process starts; this module only reads what landed.
  **Sprint 011:** gains `get_tba_api_key()`/`get_tba_url()` (reading `TBA_KEY`/`TBA_URL`),
  mirroring `get_leaguesync_api_key()`/`get_leaguesync_url()` exactly, including the
  surrounding-quote stripping SOPS-decrypted secrets need. `config.py` remains the only
  module touching `os.environ`.
  **Sprint 038:** gains `get_scrape_cache_store()`/`get_data_store()`, returning a `Store`
  (see `storage.py`) for `SCRAPE_CACHE_DIR`/`PARTNER_SCRAPE_DATA_DIR` — a local path or
  `s3://bucket/prefix`, defaulting to `s3://jtl-stem-ecosystem-scrape/{cache,data}` (local
  only when set explicitly). Config owns the one lazily built, shared boto3 client
  (`DO_SPACES_ENDPOINT` region endpoint — a bucket-qualified one is rejected —
  `DO_SPACES_ACCESS_KEY`, `DO_SPACES_SECRET_KEY`) and injects it into `storage`; missing
  `DO_SPACES_*` values fail loudly only when an `s3://` location is in effect.
  **Sprint 038 ticket 006:** `REPO_ROOT`, `DEFAULT_SITE_DIR` and the old
  `get_scrape_cache_dir()` are gone. `get_registry_dir()` (`PARTNER_SCRAPE_REGISTRY_DIR`,
  default the bundled `partner_scrape/registry_data/`; local paths only, `://` values are
  rejected) plus `get_sources_dir()/get_hubs_dir()/get_ads_dir()/get_candidates_dir()`;
  `get_candidates_write_dir()` (override's `candidates/`, else `./candidates`, never the
  bundled copy); `get_event_store_path()` (`PARTNER_SCRAPE_EVENT_DB`, else
  `~/.partner-scrape/events.db`); `get_site_dir()` is `SITE_DIR` or the CWD.
  `resolve_data_store(location)` maps an export function's `own_data_dir` argument (path,
  `s3://`, `Store`, or `None` = `get_data_store()`) to a Store.
- **`model.py`** — the canonical `Event` record and the shared identity vocabulary. A flat
  dataclass (~26 fields, sprint 009: `opportunity_type` joins the classification fields
  alongside `areas_of_interest`/`age_grade_level`/`cost_range`/`time_of_day`) plus a
  side-car `field_provenance: dict[str, Provenance]` map; `Event.set(field, value, source,
  confidence)` writes both at once. Also owns `normalize_title`, `identity_key`/
  `Event.identity_key()` (acquisition identity: "have we seen this exact record from this
  source?"), `same_record`, and (sprint 009) `slugify` — a small, shared text-to-slug
  utility promoted here from `normalize/run.py` because sprint 009 needs it in two places
  (the per-event slug in `normalize/run.py`, the per-partner slug in the new
  `export/partner_log.py`) and this is the module every other module already treats as the
  home for shared identity primitives. `Kind` is `"event" | "program" | "internship"` —
  unchanged this sprint, both non-`"event"` values already existed (`"program"` was
  reserved but unused before sprint 027).
  **(Sprint 027)** Two additive changes: `Event` gains `eligibility: str = ""` (a
  per-record eligibility note, set via `Event.set(...)` by the new program-page
  extraction path — see `adapters/DESIGN.md` — for the case a per-*source*
  `taxonomy_defaults.eligibility` default cannot express, e.g. a listing source
  whose individual program cards each need a different eligibility note); and
  `model.py` gains `PROGRAM_EXTRACTION_KINDS = frozenset({"internship",
  "program"})`, a shared constant naming which `Kind` values get the
  curated-record bypass treatment (`enrich/`'s enrichment pass, `normalize/`'s
  collapse/dedup) — generalizing what was previously a single hardcoded
  `kind == "internship"` check duplicated at three call sites across two
  modules. This is the explicit reuse surface sprints 029 (competitions) and
  030 (educator programs) build on: registering a source with `program_kind =
  "program"` gets the same bypass treatment with zero further code change.

**Sprint 033 addition.** No root-level module (`pipeline.py`, `cli.py`, `config.py`,
`model.py`) changes this sprint — `bilingual`/accessibility signals and the new `region`
classification are both derived from an `Event`'s already-existing fields at normalize
time, not stored on `Event` itself. See `normalize/DESIGN.md`, `observability/DESIGN.md`,
and `export/DESIGN.md`'s own sprint 033 sections.

## 3. Subsystem Map

Each has its own `DESIGN.md` in its own directory.

| Subsystem | One line |
|---|---|
| [`adapters/`](adapters/DESIGN.md) | Thirteen per-vendor strategies implementing `discover → fetch → extract`, dispatched by `adapter_type` through a one-line registration table. (Sprint 027) Two of the thirteen, `program_page`/`program_listing`, extract via a bespoke LLM call rather than a structured API or the HTML ladder. |
| [`discovery/`](discovery/DESIGN.md) | Resolving a source into fetchable URLs (sitemap diff, listing crawl) — plus hub scanning, which generates *organization* leads and is structurally forbidden from producing Events. |
| [`enrich/`](enrich/DESIGN.md) | The LLM layer: field recovery, controlled-vocabulary classification, and the relevance gate, behind a content-hash cache and a fail-open policy. |
| [`export/`](export/DESIGN.md) | Every write across the repo boundary into the site: `opportunities.json`, `ads.json`, self-hosted images, and (sprint 009) a persistent per-partner accumulation log plus the published `public/data/` partners-and-events contract projected from it. |
| [`extract/`](extract/DESIGN.md) | The confidence-ranked extraction ladder: one HTML page in, `{field: (value, confidence)}` out. Pure, no I/O. |
| [`fetch/`](fetch/DESIGN.md) | The only network access in the system: the `Fetcher` seam, robots.txt, per-domain throttling, on-disk conditional-GET cache, and the optional headless browser. |
| [`normalize/`](normalize/DESIGN.md) | Recurrence collapse, cross-source dedup, taxonomy derivation, partner join — `Event`s in, site-shaped `Opportunity` records out. |
| [`observability/`](observability/DESIGN.md) | Per-source yield accounting, run-over-run deltas, zero-yield and cliff alerts, and the `yield-history.json` snapshot. |
| [`registry/`](registry/DESIGN.md) | The data-driven catalog: one TOML file per organization, plus separate hub, ad, and candidate catalogs. Onboarding is a data edit. |
| [`store/`](store/DESIGN.md) | A durable SQLite table of canonical Events for future incremental scraping. Built and tested, **not wired into the pipeline**. |
| [`teams/`](teams/DESIGN.md) | (sprint 011) A second, independent pipeline: acquires FTC/FRC team rosters, resolves cross-league identity, geocodes offline, and publishes `teams.json`. Structurally disjoint from every subsystem above — no shared adapter registration, no `Opportunity`. |

## 4. Shared Conventions

Every subsystem doc under this root assumes the following without restating it.

**Injectable protocols with fixture doubles.** Every boundary to the outside world is a
`typing.Protocol` taken as a constructor or function argument: `Fetcher`, `LLMClient`,
`ImageFetcher`, `HeadlessPage`, plus `Enricher` and `Reporter` (defined in `pipeline.py`
and satisfied structurally, never by import). Production wiring picks the real
implementation at the outermost layer — `cli.py` and `pipeline.run()`; tests inject
fixture-backed doubles. This is why 905 tests run with no network access and with the
optional `playwright` dependency uninstalled.

**Storage (`storage.py`).** Persistent cache and published data go through a `Store`
protocol (`read_bytes`/`write_bytes`, text and JSON helpers, `exists`, `list`) keyed by
`/`-separated strings, with a missing key reading as `None`. `LocalStore(root)` writes
atomically (temp file + `os.replace`); `S3Store(bucket, prefix, client)` targets an
S3-compatible bucket and sets `ContentType`; `store_from_location()` picks one from an
`s3://bucket/prefix` string or a path. `storage.py` is a leaf: it never imports `config`,
which builds Stores and injects the boto3 client.

**Structural satisfaction, never a backwards import.** A module that satisfies a Protocol
defined in `pipeline.py` does not import it. `enrich.enricher.LLMEnricher`,
`observability.reporter.YieldReporter`, and `discovery.candidate_pipeline`'s own
`RelevanceGate` all follow this. Python's structural typing makes the import unnecessary,
and taking it would invert the dependency direction.

**(Sprint 014) A shared `Fetcher` must tolerate `pipeline.py`'s source-level
concurrency — and when it cannot, dispatch, not the `Fetcher`, adapts.** The default
static `Fetcher` (`PoliteFetcher` wrapping `UrllibFetcher`) is safe under concurrent
calls from multiple sources' worker threads because each call is independent and
stateless. The headless `Fetcher` (`PoliteFetcher` wrapping `PlaywrightFetcher`) is
not: a single shared Playwright browser page is not just unsafe under *concurrent*
calls but, per Playwright's own documented sync-API constraint, expected to be
driven from one consistent thread. `pipeline.py` accommodates this by routing every
`headless`-strategy source through its own dedicated single-worker executor (see
§2's `pipeline.py` bullet) rather than asking `fetch/` to somehow make an
inherently single-threaded browser driver behave as if it were not — `fetch/`'s own
`PlaywrightFetcher.get()` additionally keeps an instance-owned lock as defense in
depth, but the load-bearing guarantee is dispatch-level thread affinity, not the
lock alone. See `fetch/DESIGN.md`'s sprint 014 section for the full rationale.

**One-way dependency direction.** `pipeline` → `registry`/`adapters`/`enrich`/`normalize`/
`export`; `adapters` → `discovery`/`extract`/`fetch`/`registry`/`model`; `export` →
`normalize`; and never the reverse in any of these. `normalize/` in particular never
imports `export/` — the image downloader reaches it as a plain `Callable[[str], str]`
constructed by `pipeline.run()` precisely so that edge does not exist. `fetch/`,
`extract/`, and `model.py` are leaves.

**Errors are isolated at the level that owns the unit.** One malformed *record* is logged
and skipped inside an adapter's `extract()`. One failing *source* is logged and skipped by
`pipeline.run()`, which never lets it raise up. One unparseable *page* is logged and
skipped by discovery and by the extraction ladder. One failed *LLM call* falls back to
keyword taxonomy. The system's guiding failure principle is that a partial result ships
and the gap is *reported* by `observability/`, rather than the run aborting.

**Provenance travels with values.** `Event.set(field, value, source, confidence)` records
where every field came from and how much it is trusted. Structured APIs and JSON-LD are
1.0; the extraction ladder's lower rungs descend to 0.2; LLM enrichment is 0.7 and its
keyword fallback 0.3. `normalize/`'s collapse and dedup use those numbers to pick between
competing records, so a confidence constant is a project-wide contract, not a local
detail.

**Configuration is data, and environment is read in one place.** Adding an organization is
a new TOML file in `partner_scrape/registry_data/sources/`. `config.py` is the only module that touches
`os.environ`.

**Datetimes are naive San Diego wall clock.** Adapters should emit them that way; several
structured-API adapters do not, so `normalize.run()` coerces any timezone-aware
`start`/`end` to naive in exactly one place, because mixing the two makes date comparison
raise and crashes the run.

**Dependencies are minimal and deliberate.** `lxml` for HTML, `icalendar` and
`python-dateutil` for dates, `anthropic` for enrichment, `certifi` for TLS. HTTP is stdlib
`urllib`; TOML is stdlib `tomllib`; the store is stdlib `sqlite3`. `playwright` is an
optional extra whose import is deferred to first real use.

**Python floor is 3.11 (`requires-python = ">=3.11"`).** Re-checked in sprint 038 (ticket
012): the full suite (2617 tests) passes on CPython 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13, and nothing uses
3.12+/3.13-only syntax or stdlib. 3.11 is the true floor because the package reads TOML
with stdlib `tomllib` (added in 3.11); 3.10 fails at import. The wheel smoke test
(`dev/wheel_smoke_test.py`, CI `wheel-smoke.yml`) runs on 3.11 and 3.13.

**Tests are fixture-based and hermetic.** 905 tests, one test module per source module,
saved HTML/JSON fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`, no network, no API key required.

## 5. Interfaces

### Exposes
- **`partner-scrape`** — the console script (`partner_scrape.cli:main`). Flags include
  `--registry-dir`, `--site-dir`, `--source`, `--limit`, `--dry-run`, `--no-enrich`,
  `--no-report`, `--yield-history`, `--verbose`; plus the `discover-candidates`,
  `teams`, and `directory` subcommands. The main pipeline is `partner-scrape --source X`
  (there is no `run` subcommand).
- **`pipeline.run(...) -> list[dict]`** — the programmatic entry point; returns the
  exported opportunity payload.
- **`model.Event`, `Provenance`, `Kind`, `identity_key`, `normalize_title`,
  `same_record`** — the shared record vocabulary every subsystem speaks.
- **The site data contract** — `opportunities.json`, `scrape-meta.json`, `ads.json`, and
  `images/opportunities/*` written into `own_data_dir` (sprint 025's sole write target);
  plus, since sprint 009, the additive public data contract `public/data/partners.json`
  and each partner's `public/data/partners/<slug>/events.json` / `past-events.json`,
  projected from the new persistent per-partner accumulation store (not written into
  `src/data/`, since `src/` is Astro's own build input and this is meant to be fetchable at
  runtime as a public API — see `export/DESIGN.md`). **(Sprint 033)** `scrape-meta.json`
  gains a `"regions"` key — a per-region opportunity count. See `export/DESIGN.md`.
- **(Sprint 011) `partner-scrape teams`** — the new subcommand; and **`src/data/teams.json`**
  — a wholly separate, standalone data contract (San Diego FTC/FRC robotics teams). See
  `teams/DESIGN.md`.

### Consumes
- **`stem-ecosystem`'s `src/data/partners.json`** — read-only, for the partner join.
- **Environment** (via `config.py` only): `SCRAPE_CACHE_DIR`, `PARTNER_SCRAPE_DATA_DIR`, `PARTNER_SCRAPE_REGISTRY_DIR`, `PARTNER_SCRAPE_EVENT_DB`, `DO_SPACES_*` (sprint 038), `SITE_DIR`,
  `LEAGUESYNC_API_KEY`, `LEAGUESYNC_URL`, and (sprint 011) `TBA_KEY`/`TBA_URL`; and
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, resolved by the `anthropic` SDK itself.
- **~100 partner websites and APIs**, reached only through `fetch/`.
- **(Sprint 011) FTCScout and The Blue Alliance REST APIs**, reached only through
  `fetch.PoliteFetcher`, from `teams/sources/`.

## 6. Open Questions / Known Limitations

- `store/` is built but unused. The policy question it implies — should a source that
  failed this run keep publishing what it published last run? — is unanswered.
- There is a circular import between `adapters.listing_html` and `discovery.listing`,
  currently worked around by import ordering in `cli.py`.
- The site data contract is unversioned and unvalidated. A field rename on the site side
  shows up as missing data on a rendered page, not as an export failure. This now applies
  to two parallel contracts (`src/data/opportunities.json` and, since sprint 009,
  `public/data/partners.json` + per-partner event files) — see `export/DESIGN.md`'s Open
  Questions for why the sprint kept them parallel rather than unifying them now.
- Yield alerts are printed to the console. A zero-yield source in a scheduled run is only
  noticed if someone reads the log.
- `_TZ_OFFSET` in `normalize/run.py` is the hard-coded literal `-07:00`, so exported
  timestamps are wrong across the DST boundary.
- `scrapy` and `w3lib` remain declared dependencies but the fetch path is stdlib
  `urllib`; the declarations should be audited.
- (Sprint 011) Whether `teams.json` is ever joined to the curated partner directory is an
  open product question — only 1 of 105 distinct team organizations is already a partner;
  the other 104 are a candidate recruitment list, not resolved here. `TBA_KEY` is
  provisioned and verified locally but not yet in the scheduled workflow's GitHub Actions
  secrets — see `sprint.md`'s Migration Concerns.
- (Sprint 014) The dedicated single-worker executor for `headless`-strategy sources
  fixes correctness (and, per Playwright's documented constraint, thread affinity) but
  caps headless throughput at one source at a time, regardless of how many are flagged.
  At this sprint's scale (roughly 10-15 of ~120 sources) this is an accepted trade-off,
  not a bottleneck; if a future sprint pushes the headless-flagged count much higher,
  wall-clock time for that portion of a run would grow roughly linearly and might
  warrant a small pool of browser pages/contexts instead of one. Not built here — see
  `fetch/DESIGN.md`'s matching Open Questions entry.
