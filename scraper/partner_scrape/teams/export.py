"""`export_teams()`: the Teams pipeline's single publish entry point.

Publishes already-acquired `Team` records (`teams.sources.*` this
ticket; `teams.merge`/`teams.geo` in tickets 011-003/011-004) as
`teams.json`, filtered (nothing to filter here -- teams are undated, so
there is no current/upcoming gate), serialized, and written -- like
`export/writer.py`'s `opportunities.json`/`scrape-meta.json`, but a
*second*, independent contract, per sprint 011's Design Rationale
("`Team` is a new, separate model, not a widened `Opportunity`").

Sprint 017 (ticket 001) and sprint 020 (ticket 005, issue 60) each added
a further write target for this same payload -- first the sibling
`stem-ecosystem` checkout's `public/data/teams.json`, then
partner-scrape's own `own_data_dir` -- reaching "one publish, three
paths." Sprint 025 (ticket 004, issue 21 / stop-writing-to-
stem-ecosystem-checkout.md) removes both `stem-ecosystem`-checkout
writes (`src/data/teams.json` and `public/data/teams.json`):
partner-scrape no longer writes into a sibling checkout at all, for any
export. `own_data_dir` (the data Store, `config.get_data_store()`, by default;
a local path, `s3://` location, or `Store` may be passed) is now this function's sole write target -- "one publish,
one path." Mirrors `export/writer.py`'s `export_opportunities()` and
`export/ads.py`'s `export_ads()`, sprint 020 tickets 003/004, which
still write only their own third target the same way.

## The `teams.json` data contract

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "generated": "2026-08-28T04:13:41Z",
    "total": 152,
    "by_league": {"FTC": 152},
    "out_of_region": 6,
    "by_location_precision": {"none": 152},
    "credential_failures": []
  },
  "teams": [ {"team_id": "ftc-1622", "league": "FTC", ...}, ... ]
}
```

`meta` is deliberately not a bare sibling of `scrape-meta.json` -- it
travels *inside* `teams.json` itself (one file, self-describing),
carrying its own `generated` timestamp so a `teams` run's freshness is
never confused with the opportunities export's (see the two hard
invariants below). `by_league` and `by_location_precision` exist so
coverage and data-quality gaps (an unresolved location, a league with
no active source this run) are visible in the artifact itself, not
just in a log line -- the same "a partial result ships, the gap is
reported" principle `docs/design/design.md` Sec.5 states for the rest
of this project. `credential_failures` (sprint 023 ticket 002) is the
active counterpart to `by_league`'s passive omission signal above: an
always-present, sorted, de-duplicated list of league codes (e.g.
`["FRC", "VEX"]`) whose acquisition source failed on a credential
error this run -- `[]` on a clean run, never an absent key -- so a
downstream consumer (e.g. the stem-ecosystem peer's cross-check, issue
62) does not have to already know to check `by_league` for a missing
key in a dict with no declared complete key set to notice a structural
credential outage.

## Two hard invariants

This module **never** writes or touches `opportunities.json` or
`scrape-meta.json` -- those are `export/writer.py`'s exclusive outputs.
`scrape-meta.json` in particular carries the *opportunities* export's
last-refreshed timestamp; a `teams` run overwriting it would make the
site falsely claim opportunities were just refreshed when only teams
were. `teams.json` carries its own freshness signal in `meta.generated`
instead. Both invariants are covered by a dedicated regression test
(`tests/teams/test_export.py`) asserting the two files are
byte-identical before and after a `teams` run.

A missing or unwritable `own_data_dir` fails loudly, matching
`export_opportunities`'s contract exactly -- "fail loudly, do not
silently skip the export."

## One publish, one path

A local `own_data_dir` (sprint 020 ticket 005) is created if missing
before the write (`LocalStore` makes parent directories).
This is now this function's only write target (sprint 025 ticket 004
removed the two `stem-ecosystem`-checkout writes this section used to
describe -- see the module docstring's own history of that removal).
