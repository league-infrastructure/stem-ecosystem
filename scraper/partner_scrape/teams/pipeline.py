"""Teams pipeline orchestration: `registry -> TeamSource(s) -> export`.

Structurally parallel to `partner_scrape/pipeline.py`'s `run()` -- this
module's whole job is sequencing, not business logic (see that module's
own docstring for the same self-check): enumerate this subsystem's own
Team Registry (`teams/registry/`, not `partner_scrape/registry/
sources/`), dispatch each active source to its `TeamSource`
implementation via `teams.sources.base.run()`, and hand the accumulated
`Team[]` to `teams.export.export_teams()`. It never imports
`partner_scrape.pipeline` or anything under `partner_scrape.adapters`
-- see `teams/sources/base.py`'s module docstring for why that boundary
is structural, not stylistic.

**No dispatch registry equivalent to `adapters.base.ADAPTERS`.**
`sources.base.run()` takes its `TeamSource` as an explicit argument
rather than looking one up in a shared table (see that module's own
docstring). `_TEAM_SOURCES` below is this module's own private mapping
from a Team Registry entry's `adapter_type` to the `TeamSource`
instance that handles it -- it is not exported, not imported by
anything else, and provides no path back into
`partner_scrape.pipeline.run()`. This is a plain lookup dict local to
the one caller that needs it, not a second `ADAPTERS`-shaped public
extension point.

Ticket 011-003 added the `"tba"` entry below plus a `merge_teams()`
call after every source has run and before export -- cross-league
organizational identity (`teams.merge`) has to see the full, combined
`Team[]` from every source, so it cannot run inside the per-source
loop. The per-source try/except this module already had (ticket
011-002) needed no change to give TBA the same isolation Migration
Concerns calls for (a missing/401 `TBA_KEY` degrades to FTC-only
output, never fails the whole run): `sources/tba.py`'s `discover()`
raises on a credential/probe failure by design (see its own module
docstring), and this loop already treats any `Exception` from
`run_team_source()` as "log and skip this source," regardless of which
source raised it.

Ticket 011-004 adds one more stage after `merge_teams()` and before
`export_teams()`: `teams.geo.geocode_teams()`, the seven-rung offline
location resolver. Like `merge_teams()`, it runs exactly once over the
full merged `Team[]` (not per-source) and is not wrapped in its own
try/except -- a malformed geocoding data file is a build-time defect
`teams.geo.SchoolIndex` raises loudly for (see that module's own
docstring), not a per-record failure to isolate the way a source's
network fetch is.

Sprint 013 ticket 006 adds one more stage, after `geocode_teams()` and
before `export_teams()`: `teams.website_overrides.
apply_website_overrides()`, which cleans junk/malformed values out of
the existing `website` field and applies a committed overlay of
websites/social links discovered by a web-search pass for teams whose
upstream source reported none (see that module's own docstring). It
runs *before* sprint 013's `teams.scrape.verify_team_websites()` (ticket
001, whose `depends-on` now includes ticket 006) so that stage fetches
the corrected, enlarged website set rather than the smaller, partly-
broken one this pipeline originally assumed. Like `merge_teams()`/
`geocode_teams()`, it is not wrapped in its own try/except -- a
malformed overlay data file is a build-time defect
`website_overrides._load_overlay` raises loudly for, not a per-record
failure to isolate.

Sprint 013 ticket 001 adds the next stage, immediately after
`apply_website_overrides()` and before `export_teams()`:
`teams.scrape.verify_team_websites()`, which fetches every team's
(corrected, enlarged) `website` through this same `fetcher` parameter,
robots-checked first (`fetch.is_allowed()`, matching
`discovery/hub_scan.py::scan_hub()`'s per-page pattern), and sets
`Team.website_status` to `"confirmed"`/`"unverified"`/`"none"`. Unlike
`merge_teams()`/`geocode_teams()`/`apply_website_overrides()`, this
stage's own per-team fetch failures are already isolated *inside*
`verify_team_websites()` itself (never raising for one team's dead
link or robots disallow), so `run_teams()` does not additionally wrap
this call in a try/except either -- the one case this stage can still
raise for is a `Fetcher`-level bug, which is exactly as fatal here as
it would be for any other stage. Its returned `dict[team_id, html]` is
kept as a local variable (`fetch_results`, deliberately never assigned
to any `Team` field or `run_teams()`'s own return value -- see
`teams.scrape`'s own module docstring) for `teams.sponsor_extract.
extract_sponsors()` to consume.

Sprint 013 ticket 005 adds the next stage, immediately after
`verify_team_websites()` and before `export_teams()`:
`teams.sponsor_extract.extract_sponsors()`, which consumes
`fetch_results` (never assigned to a `Team` field, as above) to gather
candidates, classify them via the injectable `llm_client`, validate/
denylist-guard the result, and merge surviving names into
`Team.sponsors`/`Team.sponsor_provenance`. `llm_client`/`sponsor_cache`
are new `run_teams()` parameters, defaulting to a real
`AnthropicSponsorLLMClient()`/`SponsorCache()` when omitted -- the same
default-to-production convention `fetcher` already follows -- but
constructed lazily, only when this stage actually runs, so a
`--no-sponsors` run never touches the `anthropic` SDK at all. Like
`verify_team_websites()`, `extract_sponsors()` isolates its own
per-team failures internally (fail-open, SUC-004's Error Flows), so no
additional try/except wraps this call either.

Ticket 005's reopening adds one more stage, immediately after the
`extract_sponsors()`/`--no-sponsors` branch above and before
`export_teams()`: `teams.sponsor_canonical.canonicalize_sponsors()`,
which mutates the full `Team[]` in place so the same real company is
published under one consistent display name everywhere it is
mentioned, not just within one team's own `sponsors` list -- see that
module's own docstring for why a per-team merge (`extract_sponsors()`'s
own step 6) can never catch a company two *different* teams' own
structured records happen to spell differently. Runs unconditionally,
even under `--no-sponsors`, since a purely-structured sponsor list
still needs this cross-team pass. Like `merge_teams()`/`geocode_teams()`
above, it is not wrapped in its own try/except -- it never raises for
any input it can receive here.

Sprint 016 ticket 005 adds a fourth entry, `"robotevents"` (VEX
Robotics Competition, CA Region 4 -- see `sources/robotevents.py`'s own
module docstring). Like TBA, its `discover()` raises on any probe
failure (missing/invalid `ROBOTEVENTS_KEY` included) rather than
degrading gracefully, so this loop's existing per-source
`try`/`except` isolates it identically -- no VEX-specific case needed
here either.

Sprint 021 ticket 004 adds one more stage, immediately after
`canonicalize_sponsors()` and before `export_teams()`:
`teams.description_extract.extract_descriptions()`, which reuses the
same `fetch_results` dict `extract_sponsors()` already consumes (no
second fetch) to gather a bounded content string per confirmed team
page (`teams.description_candidates.gather_description_content()`),
summarize it via the injectable `description_llm_client` (never
generating from open context -- only summarizing the already-gathered,
bounded text), validate the raw response against a no-email guard and a
length cap, and publish `Team.description`/`description_status`/
`description_provenance`/`description_fetched_at`. `description_llm_client`/
`description_cache` are new `run_teams()` parameters, defaulting to a
real `AnthropicDescriptionLLMClient()`/`DescriptionCache()` when
omitted -- the same default-to-production convention `llm_client`/
`sponsor_cache` already follow for sponsor extraction -- but
constructed lazily, only when this stage actually runs, so a
`--no-descriptions` run never touches the `anthropic` SDK at all. Like
`extract_sponsors()`, `extract_descriptions()` isolates its own
per-team failures internally (fail-open, SUC-023's Error Flows), so no
additional try/except wraps this call either.

Sprint 012 adds a third entry, `"static_roster"` (the committed FLL
roster -- see `sources/static_roster.py`'s own module docstring), plus
one new pre-flight check: `_check_sunset_seasons()`, called once per
`run_teams()` call, right after the (possibly `--source`-filtered)
active source list is resolved and before any source runs. It inspects
every active source's `SourceConfig.config.get("sunset_season")` and
logs exactly one `logging.WARNING` for the whole run if `today` (real
`date.today()` by default; tests pass an explicit `today` the same way
`export.export_opportunities()`'s own `today` parameter works) is past
any of their parsed season-end dates -- never more than one log call
regardless of how many sources are stale, and never raises: a sunset
date is a staleness signal for an operator to notice, not a reason to
stop publishing what may still be the best available data (see
`teams/DESIGN.md`'s Constraints).

Sprint 023 ticket 001 adds a second alerting convention alongside
`_check_sunset_seasons()`'s pre-flight one, this time inside the
per-source loop itself: a source whose acquisition raises
`config.CredentialError` (a missing/invalid `TBA_KEY`/
`ROBOTEVENTS_KEY`, or a live 401 -- see that class's own docstring)
still gets the exact same per-source `logger.exception()` ERROR log
every other failure gets, unchanged, but is additionally recorded;
once the per-source loop finishes, exactly one aggregate
`logger.warning()` names every league/source that failed on a
credential error, mirroring `_check_sunset_seasons()`'s own "never
more than one log call regardless of how many are affected"
convention. The point (issue 62) is telling a structural, recurring
credential outage -- one an operator must fix, that will keep
recurring on every run until they do -- apart from a one-off scrape
hiccup that is indistinguishable from it today, without loosening the
per-source isolation this loop already gives every failure: a
credential failure still degrades, never aborts, the run -- this
ticket only adds a *second*, additional signal on top of the existing
isolation, it does not change the isolation itself. `_SOURCE_LEAGUES`
below is this addition's own private `adapter_type -> League` lookup,
matching `_TEAM_SOURCES`'s existing "private lookup local to the one
caller that needs it" convention, not a new public registry.

Sprint 036 ticket 001 adds a fifth entry, `"team_static_roster"` (the
generic curated STEM-competition-team roster source -- see
`sources/team_static_roster.py`'s own module docstring). Like
`"static_roster"` (FLL), it is a "source" in name and protocol shape
only -- there is no acquisition step to isolate a failure from, only a
local file read -- so this loop's existing per-source `try`/`except`
isolates it identically, and it is deliberately **not** added to
`_SOURCE_LEAGUES`: that lookup exists only to name which league a
`config.CredentialError` failure belongs to, and a static-roster source
never raises one (no credential to fail). This ticket adds the
mechanism only; ticket 002 registers the first two real entries
(Science Olympiad, CyberPatriot).

Sprint 023 ticket 002 adds a *third* signal, this time in the
published artifact itself rather than the run log: the same league
codes collected into `credential_failures` above are threaded through
`export_teams()`'s new `credential_failures` parameter into
`teams.export._build_meta()`, which publishes them as an always-
present, sorted, de-duplicated `meta.credential_failures` key in
`teams.json` (`[]` on a clean run). Ticket 001's aggregate log warning
is only visible to whoever captures that specific run's log; this
extends the same signal into the artifact that actually ships and gets
read downstream (issue 62's own text: the existing `by_league`-omission
signal is "a much weaker guarantee than an active alert"). See
`export.py`'s own module docstring and `_build_meta()`'s docstring for
the payload side of this.

    `meta.credential_failures` key in the returned/written `teams.json`
    payload itself -- `[]` on a clean run -- not just in this run's log.

    Args:
        registry_dir: Team Registry directory to load sources from.
            Defaults to :data:`DEFAULT_TEAMS_REGISTRY_DIR` (the real
            seed registry, `partner_scrape/teams/registry/`) when
            omitted.
        source: when given, restricts the run to the single acquisition
            source whose `adapter_type` matches (e.g. `"ftcscout"` or
            `"tba"`) -- the CLI's `--source` flag. Unlike
            `pipeline.run()`'s `source_id` filter (which matches a
            registry file's stem), this matches the *kind* of source,
            since a TBA outage needs to be isolated by acquisition
            method, not by which one organization's TOML file it came
            from.
        fetcher: the `Fetcher` every active source retrieves raw
            content through. Defaults to a real `PoliteFetcher()` when
            omitted -- the production path. Tests inject a fixture
            `Fetcher` here so the whole run touches no sockets.
        dry_run: when `True`, compute and return the would-be-written
            export payload without touching disk (`export_teams`
            honors this the same way `export_opportunities` does).
        geo_data_dir: the offline geocoding data directory
            `teams.geo.geocode_teams()` reads. Defaults to
            `teams.geo.DEFAULT_DATA_DIR` (the real committed
            `teams/data/`) when omitted. Tests that need to control
            geocoding outcomes precisely should pass an explicit
            fixture directory here; tests that only care about
            source/merge behavior can safely omit it and exercise the
            real committed data files, matching this module's existing
            "trust the real registry in tests" convention.
        website_data_dir: the directory `teams.website_overrides.
            apply_website_overrides()` reads `discovered-websites.toml`
            from (sprint 013 ticket 006). Defaults to
            `website_overrides.DEFAULT_DATA_DIR` (the real committed
            `teams/data/`) when omitted, mirroring `geo_data_dir`'s
            convention exactly. Tests that need to control the overlay
            precisely should pass an explicit fixture directory here.
        llm_client: the injectable `SponsorLLMClient`
            `extract_sponsors()` (sprint 013 ticket 005) classifies
            sponsor candidates through. Defaults to a real
            `AnthropicSponsorLLMClient()` when omitted -- the same
            default-to-production convention `fetcher` already follows
            -- constructed lazily, only when sponsor extraction actually
            has at least one confirmed page to look at (`no_sponsors`
            is `False` and `verify_team_websites()` produced a non-empty
            `fetch_results`), so a `--no-sponsors` run and every test
            that only cares about acquisition/merge/geocoding never
            touch the `anthropic` SDK at all. Tests that do exercise
            sponsor extraction inject a `FixtureSponsorLLMClient` here.
        sponsor_cache: the `SponsorCache` `extract_sponsors()` looks up
            and stores classification results in. Defaults to a real
            `SponsorCache()` (the real configured cache directory) when
            omitted, constructed lazily for the same reason as
            `llm_client` above. Tests should always pass an explicit
            `tmp_path`-based `SponsorCache` here.
        no_sponsors: when `True`, skip `extract_sponsors()` entirely --
            the CLI's `--no-sponsors` flag. `verify_team_websites()`
            always runs regardless (SUC-001's cheap, certain half is
            unconditional); only sponsor classification (the
            uncertain, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`-dependent, Anthropic-API-cost
            half) is skippable.
        description_llm_client: the injectable `DescriptionLLMClient`
            `extract_descriptions()` (sprint 021 ticket 004) summarizes
            gathered team-website content through. Defaults to a real
            `AnthropicDescriptionLLMClient()` when omitted -- the same
            default-to-production convention `llm_client` already
            follows for sponsor extraction -- constructed lazily, only
            when description extraction actually has at least one
            confirmed page to look at (`no_descriptions` is `False` and
            `verify_team_websites()` produced a non-empty
            `fetch_results`), so a `--no-descriptions` run and every
            test that only cares about acquisition/merge/geocoding/
            sponsor extraction never touches the `anthropic` SDK for
            this stage at all. Tests that do exercise description
            extraction inject a `FixtureDescriptionLLMClient` here.
        description_cache: the `DescriptionCache` `extract_descriptions()`
            looks up and stores summarization results in. Defaults to a
            real `DescriptionCache()` (the real configured cache
            directory) when omitted, constructed lazily for the same
            reason as `description_llm_client` above. Tests should
            always pass an explicit `tmp_path`-based `DescriptionCache`
            here.
        no_descriptions: when `True`, skip `extract_descriptions()`
            entirely -- the CLI's `--no-descriptions` flag.
            `verify_team_websites()`/`extract_sponsors()` always run
            regardless; only description summarization (the uncertain,
            `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`-dependent, Anthropic-API-cost half) is
