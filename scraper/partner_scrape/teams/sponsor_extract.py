"""Sponsor extraction orchestration (``teams.sponsor_extract``).

Sprint 013 ticket 005: the piece that actually runs sponsor extraction --
everything tickets 001 (fetched page bodies), 003
(``sponsor_candidates.gather_sponsor_candidates``), and 004
(``sponsor_llm.SponsorLLMClient``/``sponsor_cache.SponsorCache``) built
gets wired together here into one per-team pipeline stage:

    gather candidates -> cache lookup -> classify on a miss ->
    verbatim-candidate validation -> denylist guard (defense-in-depth) ->
    normalize/dedup/merge into ``Team.sponsors`` -> ``Team.sponsor_provenance``
    updated.

:func:`extract_sponsors` mutates ``teams`` in place, parallel in shape to
``teams.merge.merge_teams()``/``teams.geo.geocode_teams()``, and is called
once by ``teams.pipeline.run_teams()`` after ``verify_team_websites()``
(ticket 001) and before ``export_teams()``.

**This module is the actual security boundary's enforcement point.**
``sponsor_candidates.py`` never invents a name (it only lifts strings
present on the page); ``sponsor_llm.py``'s prompt asks the model to
*select*, never *generate*. Neither of those is a code-level guarantee on
its own -- a misbehaving or adversarially-prompted model could still
return a name absent from the candidate list. :func:`extract_sponsors`
is where that is actually checked and enforced: any name returned by
``classify_sponsors()`` that is not present verbatim in the candidate
list :func:`~partner_scrape.teams.sponsor_candidates.gather_sponsor_candidates`
produced is dropped and logged, never published (sprint.md's Design
Rationale, "the deterministic candidate-gathering pass is the actual
security boundary, the LLM only narrows within it" -- this is the layer
that turns that narrowing into a hard code-level guarantee). A small
denylist (common CMS/hosting vendor names, the team's own
``organization``, the page's own hostname) is layered on top as
defense-in-depth, catching anything a permissive classification might
still let through even after the verbatim check.

Sponsor-name deduplication uses ``teams.sponsor_canonical.canonical_key``
as the match key -- ``normalize.partners.normalize_org_name`` (never a
second normalizer, per sprint.md's Design Rationale) plus a corporate-
suffix strip ``sponsor_canonical.py`` layers on top of it (added when
this ticket was reopened: the corporate-suffix gap below meant a
structured "Qualcomm" and a scraped "Qualcomm Inc." for the same team
did not originally collapse -- see that module's own docstring for the
full story). A scraped name whose canonical key already appears among a
team's existing (structured) sponsors is absorbed into that entry
rather than duplicated -- the structured display name and
``"structured"`` provenance always win over a same-company scraped
variant. Cross-team canonicalization (the same company spelled
differently by two different teams' own structured records) is
``teams.pipeline.run_teams()``'s separate
``sponsor_canonical.canonicalize_sponsors()`` pass, run once over the
whole team list after this module's own per-team extraction -- see that
module's docstring.

Every per-team failure -- a network error, a malformed LLM response
(``SponsorClassificationError``), a missing ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` -- is
caught here and logged, leaving that team's ``sponsors``/
``sponsor_provenance`` exactly as the structured sources already set
them. This matches ``enrich/``'s project-wide "fail open, always"
convention (SUC-004's Error Flows): one team's classification failure
never aborts the run, and never touches any other team.

Deliberately mirrors, but never imports, ``enrich/``'s orchestration
shape. ``teams/`` has a standing, explicitly documented invariant of
zero edges into ``enrich/``, ``adapters/``, ``normalize.run()``, or
``pipeline.run()`` -- this module imports only
``normalize.partners.normalize_org_name`` (reused read-only, the one
sanctioned exception, matching ``teams.merge``'s own precedent) plus
sibling ``teams/`` modules.
