"""The canonical Team record (``teams/model.py``).

A ``Team`` is a standing directory entity -- a FIRST robotics team
fielded by a school or a family/community group -- with no date, no
recurrence, and no relevance gate. It is deliberately a separate
dataclass from ``partner_scrape.model.Event``, not a widened ``Kind``:
``export/writer.py``'s current-and-upcoming filter would silently drop
every Team if it were routed through ``Opportunity``, and widening
``Kind`` would ripple into ``enrich/enricher.py``, ``normalize/run.py``,
and ``export/writer.py`` for no reuse (no date, no recurrence, no
taxonomy in common). See ``teams/DESIGN.md`` and
``clasi/sprints/011-robot-teams/sprint.md``'s Design Rationale.

Fields are populated directly by each source's ``extract()``
(``sources/ftcscout.py`` for this ticket; ``sources/tba.py`` in ticket
011-003), then progressively enriched by later pipeline stages this
ticket does not implement: ``merge.py`` (ticket 011-003) sets
``org_key``/``sibling_team_ids`` for cross-league identity;
``geo.py`` (ticket 011-004) sets ``latitude``/``longitude``/
``location_precision``/``organization_website``/``matched_name``/
``needs_review``. A freshly-extracted ``Team`` therefore has
``location_precision == "none"`` and no coordinates -- that is correct
for this ticket, not a bug: no geocoding rung has run yet.

**No ``email`` field, anywhere on this dataclass.** This is a
structural guarantee, not an omission to remember to avoid later: the
FLL seed a follow-on sprint may eventually ingest
(``data/robot-teams.json``) carries 40 email addresses, including six
volunteer coaches' personal Gmail accounts, and there must be nowhere
on this record to put one. Do not add one, even behind a flag.

#: ``robotevents.py`` -- hands ``league`` a single hard-coded literal it

#: reads ``league`` from untrusted TSV rows and needs something to
