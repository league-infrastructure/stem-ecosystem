"""`LLMEnricher`: `pipeline.Enricher`'s first real implementation.

See sprint.md's Architecture > LLM Enricher, SUC-011 (recover fields and
classify an Event via LLM enrichment) and SUC-012 (gate irrelevant
events out of the export via the relevance verdict). Fulfills
`pipeline.Enricher`'s deferred seam (`pipeline.py`'s `Enricher` Protocol)
with zero changes to `pipeline.py` -- exactly the seam sprint 001 paid
for.

Per-Event flow (SUC-011's Main Flow):
0. `kind="internship"` Events (sprint 006 ticket 005, SUC-005) bypass
   this entire flow: no cache lookup, no `LLMClient` call, no field
   mutation -- the Event is appended to the survivors list unchanged.
   An internship arrives already classified/gated deterministically by
   `adapters/ats_filters.py`, and this module's LLM prompt is written
   specifically around a "STEM learning opportunity for K-12 youth"
   framing that could misjudge legitimate job-posting text as
   adult-only and silently drop it -- see sprint.md's Design Rationale.
1. Compute the Event's `identity_key()` and check the `EnrichmentCache`.
2. Cache hit (same content hash) -> reapply the cached `EnrichmentResult`
   to the Event via `Event.set(...)`, no LLM call (cost control).
3. Cache miss or changed content -> call the injected `LLMClient`, apply
   the result, write a fresh cache entry.
4. LLM call raises (malformed response, network/API failure -- any
   exception the call raises, not only `LLMEnrichmentError`; see
   sprint.md's Design Rationale "on any LLM/API failure the Enricher
   fails open") -> log a warning, fall back to `normalize.taxonomy`'s
   keyword derivation, mark `relevant=True`, and do **not** write a
   cache entry (so the next run retries the LLM rather than caching a
   degraded result).
5. Filter the returned list: exclude any Event with `relevant=False`
   (SUC-012's gate) -- unless `event.trusted` is set (OOP, 2026-07-20:
   a first-party curated source, e.g. `adapters/leaguesync.py`'s
   classes, that must never be gate-dropped even though it is still
   enriched/classified normally). One Event's gating/error never
   affects any other Event in the same batch -- each is handled
   independently, matching `pipeline.py`'s own per-source isolation
   convention.

Bounded-concurrency fast-follow (sprint.md's Open Question 6: a full
corpus refresh made ~100 minutes of pure sequential LLM latency): the
LLM calls themselves -- the only slow, independent-per-Event step --
run in a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, everything else stays sequential on the
main thread:

1. SEQUENTIAL pass over ``events`` in order: internship bypass (kind 0
   above, no LLM/cache touch at all), cache hits (applied immediately,
   no LLM call), or a "miss" collected for the concurrent pass. This
   pass does all cache reads -- reads are safe to keep on the main
   thread and this keeps `EnrichmentCache.lookup` single-threaded too.
2. CONCURRENT pass: every miss's `llm_client.enrich_event()` call is
   submitted to a `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers)`.
   Each call only reads its own Event and returns a fresh
   `EnrichmentResult` (or raises) -- no shared mutable state crosses
   threads except each future's own return value/exception.
3. SEQUENTIAL apply pass, back on the main thread, iterating the
   misses in their *original* order (not completion order): apply the
   result (or the fail-open taxonomy fallback, same as before) via
   `Event.set(...)`, and call `EnrichmentCache.store()` -- cache writes
   stay strictly single-threaded to avoid file races, matching
   `EnrichmentCache`'s one-JSON-file-per-Event on-disk layout.
4. The relevance gate is then applied once, over the full input
   ``events`` list in its original order -- so the returned list's
   order and membership are identical to the fully-sequential
   implementation for any given input; concurrency only changes how
   fast the LLM calls happen, never the result. `max_workers=1` behaves
   identically to the old strictly-sequential code path.
