"""The ``LLMClient`` protocol, ``EnrichmentResult``, and its one real
implementation, ``AnthropicLLMClient``.

See sprint.md's Architecture > LLM Client: the injectable interface to
one LLM enrichment call, paired with its real implementation in the
same module -- exactly the pattern ``fetch/fetcher.py`` already
established for ``Fetcher``/``UrllibFetcher`` in sprint 001. Every other
module that needs LLM enrichment (ticket 005's ``LLMEnricher``) depends
on ``LLMClient``, never on the ``anthropic`` SDK directly.

Dependency direction (sprint.md's Component & Dependency Diagram):
``LLM Client`` is a leaf/infrastructure module depending on nothing in
this package except Event Model -- it deliberately does not import
``normalize/taxonomy.py`` even though the controlled vocabularies below
overlap with it; duplication here is the accepted cost of keeping this
module's one outward dependency the external Anthropic API, not another
in-package module.

``AnthropicLLMClient`` constructs ``anthropic.Anthropic()`` with **no**
explicit ``api_key`` -- the SDK resolves ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` (or
another configured credential) itself. This is deliberately not a
``config.py`` accessor; see sprint.md's Impact on Existing Components
for why that is not a boundary violation.
