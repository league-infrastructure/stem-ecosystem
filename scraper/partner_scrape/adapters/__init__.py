"""Adapter Framework: converts a registered source into canonical Events.

See ``sprint.md``'s Architecture > Adapter Framework for the design: the
``Adapter`` contract (``discover -> fetch -> extract``, chained by
:func:`run`), dispatched by ``SourceConfig.adapter_type`` via
:data:`ADAPTERS`. Adding a new adapter type is a one-line addition
below -- never a change to ``base.py``'s dispatch mechanism, as ticket
005's ``wp_rest``/``ical`` registration below demonstrates.
