"""The ``generic_html`` Adapter: sitemap discovery + the extraction ladder.

See ``sprint.md``'s Architecture > ``generic_html`` Adapter, SUC-009 and
SUC-010. This module is thin glue only, per sprint.md's Design
Rationale on why Sitemap Discovery and the Generic HTML Extractor are
separate modules from the adapter itself: ``discover()`` delegates
entirely to ``discovery.sitemap.discover_changed_urls`` (ticket 001),
``fetch()`` is the same standard ``fetcher.get(ref.url)`` every
structured-API adapter uses, and ``extract()`` delegates field recovery
to ``extract.ladder.extract_fields`` before constructing the one thing
that *is* this module's job: the canonical ``Event``.
