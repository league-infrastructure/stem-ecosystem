"""BiblioCommons library-system events API adapter.

BiblioCommons is the shared events/catalog platform behind San Diego
County Library (``sdcl.bibliocommons.com``) and San Diego Public
Library (``sandiego.bibliocommons.com``) -- confirmed live (2026-07-19)
by probing ``https://sdpl.bibliocommons.com/info/select_library``'s
library-picker dropdown, which lists both as ``<option value="sdcl">San
Diego County Library</option>`` and ``<option value="sandiego">San
Diego Public Library</option>``. Per ``dev/SCRAPER_GUIDELINES.md``
Section 3, SDCL alone accounted for ~1,173 dated events in the earlier
HTML-scrape analysis -- the single biggest event-volume source this
project handles.

**Endpoint used**: the structured JSON gateway API, not the HTML
fallback ``dev/SCRAPER_GUIDELINES.md`` Section 3 describes. Live
probing found the current BiblioCommons front end
(``{subdomain}.bibliocommons.com/events/search``) redirects (200) to a
client-rendered ``/v2/events`` React SPA shell with no server-rendered
event markup at all -- the CSS-selector approach that guideline
documents (``.event-summary-title``, ``<time datetime>``, etc.)
predates this SPA rewrite and no longer applies to either library. The
real data source **is** the JSON gateway both the SPA and the old HTML
approach ultimately read from::

    GET https://gateway.bibliocommons.com/v2/libraries/{subdomain}/events?page={page}&limit={limit}

confirmed live against ``sdcl`` (HTTP 200, structured JSON, thousands
of dated upcoming events, no past events observed across a full-range
sample -- the endpoint already scopes to current/upcoming without an
explicit date filter, matching ``tec_rest``'s ``start_date=now``
convention but for free). Pagination is page/limit-based, with
``events.pagination.pages`` telling the client how many pages exist --
the same probe-then-paginate shape ``tec.py``/``localist.py`` already
use.

**SDPL's events feature is confirmed disabled** on BiblioCommons: the
same gateway call against ``sandiego`` returns HTTP 403 with
``{"error": {"message": "The Events feature is not available at San
Diego Public Library"}}`` -- SDPL evidently runs its real events
program through a different system (``dev/SCRAPER_GUIDELINES.md``
Section 3's separately-documented "Drupal Events (sandiego.gov)"
extractor targets exactly this). SDPL is still registered here
(``registry/sources/sdpl.toml``, ``config.subdomain = "sandiego"``)
with a real, confirmed subdomain rather than omitted, because this
adapter's existing non-200 handling (below,
identical to ``tec_rest``/``localist``'s "probe fails -> degrade to one
page; non-200 page -> log and yield zero events, never raise") already
copes with this source correctly and for free: it will yield zero
events today without crashing the run, and will start working with no
code changes the day BiblioCommons enables Events for SDPL. Zero
results from a real, reachable source is a legitimate non-error state,
matching this registry's existing convention for a company's genuinely
empty Greenhouse board (see ``boundlessbio.toml``).

**Field-mapping decisions** (implementer's call, documented per this
project's convention):
- ``eventTypes`` -> ``Event.categories`` (mirrors ``tags``/
  ``categories`` conventions elsewhere: BiblioCommons' "type" taxonomy
  -- "Storytime", "STEAM", "Book Club", etc. -- is the closest match to
  what TEC/Localist call categories).
- ``eventAudiences`` -> ``Event.age_grade_level`` -- BiblioCommons'
  audience taxonomy ("Kids", "Teens", "Birth to Five", "Older Adults
  55+", ...) is an explicit, first-party age/audience signal, exactly
  what this field is for.

**Deterministic YOUTH/FAMILY audience pre-filter** (cost-avoidance,
added once SDCL volume was measured live): ``extract()`` drops any
record whose resolved ``eventAudiences`` names carry no YOUTH/FAMILY
signal, *before* building an ``Event`` for it -- see
:data:`YOUTH_FAMILY_AUDIENCE_KEYWORDS`, :data:`KEEP_IF_UNKNOWN_AUDIENCE`,
and :func:`_passes_audience_prefilter`. SDCL alone returns ~7,287
events, the large majority adult book clubs, tech-help sessions, and
wellness classes -- this filter keeps that volume from ever reaching
the (paid) LLM relevance gate, which still makes the final
STEM-for-youth call on whatever survives. Events with no resolvable
audience data are kept, not dropped (keep-if-unknown), and the whole
filter can be disabled per-source via the
``audience_prefilter: false`` config key.
- ``eventPrograms`` (an event's optional named program, e.g. "Summer at
  Your Library") -> ``Event.tags``, kept a separate list from
  categories per the existing tags/categories split.
- No ``cost`` mapping: BiblioCommons event records carry no cost field
  at all (library programs are free; there is nothing analogous to
  TEC's ``cost``/``cost_details``), so ``Event.cost`` is simply never
  set by this adapter.
- ``registration_url`` is always the constructed BiblioCommons event
  detail page (``https://{subdomain}.bibliocommons.com/events/{id}``,
  confirmed live to 200 and render that event's title), regardless of
  ``registrationInfo.provider`` -- BiblioCommons' own event page
  surfaces registration UI (or the external link) for every provider
  value observed live (``EXTERNAL``, ``BIBLIO_EVENTS``, ``None``), so
  it is the one registration/detail URL guaranteed to resolve.

**Per-occurrence rows, and why no id-collapsing dedup is needed** (the
task's "dedupe recurring instances (like Localist)" concern):
unlike Localist -- which repeats the *same* event ``id`` once per
matching calendar day within a query window -- BiblioCommons already
gives every future occurrence of a recurring series its own distinct
``id`` (only ``seriesId`` is shared). A live sample confirmed the same
``seriesId`` legitimately appearing multiple times on one page with
different ``id``s and different ``start`` dates (e.g. "Tai Chi Exercise
Class" on both 2026-10-29 and 2026-12-29) -- these are genuinely
different bookable occurrences, not duplicate rows of the same one, so
each is correctly emitted as its own ``Event``. :func:`extract` still
keeps a defensive within-page ``seen_ids`` guard (matching
``localist.py``'s convention) in case the same ``id`` were ever repeated
within one page's ``items`` list, but it is not expected to trigger in
practice.
