"""The ``listing_html`` Adapter: listing-page discovery + the extraction ladder.

See ``sprint.md``'s Architecture > ``listing_html`` Adapter, SUC-014. This
module is thin glue only, structurally parallel to ``generic_html.py``
(same ``fetch()``, same ``extract.ladder.extract_fields`` call, same
``Event`` construction) and per sprint.md's Design Rationale on why
Listing-Page Discovery and the Generic HTML Extractor stay separate
modules from the adapter itself: ``discover()`` delegates entirely to
``discovery.listing.discover_via_listing`` (ticket 003) instead of
``discovery.sitemap.discover_changed_urls`` -- the only difference from
``generic_html`` -- and ``extract()`` delegates field recovery to
``extract.ladder.extract_fields`` (unchanged, sprint 002) before
constructing the canonical ``Event``.

        A non-200 fetch or a page with no usable title anywhere in the
        ladder is dropped -- logged and skipped, never raised, matching
        sprint 001's per-record error isolation convention (one bad page
        must not fail the rest of the source). Fleet's real detail pages
        carry no JSON-LD or ``<time>`` markup (confirmed live during
        sprint 003 planning), so in practice the OpenGraph and
        title-fallback rungs are what fire here, not the top JSON-LD/
        ``<time>`` rungs -- the ladder's existing priority order already
        handles this gracefully; no new rung is needed.

        Sprint 015 ticket 004: if no ladder rung recovered a ``location``
        field, ``Event.location`` falls back to
        ``source.config.get("default_location", "")`` -- a
        registry-generic convention (see this module's Sprint 015
        addendum in ``DESIGN.md``), not Fleet-specific code. A source
        with no ``default_location`` key reproduces today's behavior

        ladder-recovered ``location`` is never overridden.
