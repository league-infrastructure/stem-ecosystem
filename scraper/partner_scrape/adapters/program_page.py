"""The ``program_page``/``program_listing``/``program_page_multi`` Adapters:
LLM-extracted program pages.

Sprint 027 tickets 003/004; ``program_page_multi`` added by ticket 006's
exception-revision cycle (ticket 008). See ``adapters/DESIGN.md``'s
sprint 027 section (and its Revision note) and sprint.md's SUC-031/
SUC-032: given one registered program page URL (a paid summer research
placement, an internship, a scholarship, or similar application-window
program) -- or, for ``program_listing``, a listing page whose cards each
link to one such page, or, for ``program_page_multi``, one page whose
body holds N such records inline -- fetch it and call the ticket-002 LLM
extraction client (``program_llm.py``) to turn its raw prose into one or
more canonical ``Event``s carrying deadline-first fields -- ``kind``,
``start``/``end``, ``eligibility``, ``opportunity_type`` -- that no
structured API publishes and no deterministic ``extract/`` ladder rung
could recover.

Structurally parallel to every other single-page adapter in this package
(``greenhouse.py``/``lever.py``'s "no probe-then-paginate" ``discover()``,
``listing_html.py``'s "fetch, map, construct one Event" ``extract()``),
substituting one LLM extraction call plus a content-hash cache lookup for
the structured-API JSON parse / HTML ladder those adapters use instead.
``ProgramPageAdapter`` and ``ProgramListingAdapter`` are the ``program_page``/
``listing_html`` pair's own analogue: identical fetch/extract, differing
only in ``discover()`` -- see :func:`_extract_one_program`, the shared
helper both classes' ``extract()`` calls, mirroring
``generic_html.py``/``listing_html.py``'s shared ``extract.ladder.
extract_fields()`` extraction step. ``ProgramPageMultiAdapter`` shares
``ProgramPageAdapter``'s ``discover()``/``fetch()`` verbatim and calls
:func:`_extract_many_programs` instead, the list-valued sibling of
:func:`_extract_one_program` -- both call the same per-result mapping
helper, :func:`_map_result_to_event`, so a single result and one of N
results are always mapped onto an ``Event`` identically.

**Constructor-injection deviation** (documented in ``adapters/DESIGN.md``'s
§3): unlike every other adapter, these adapters accept optional
``llm_client``/``cache`` overrides so tests can substitute
``program_llm.FixtureProgramLLMClient`` without touching a network socket.
``get_adapter()``'s zero-arg construction (``base.py``, unchanged) still
produces a fully-working production instance -- the defaults construct a
real ``AnthropicProgramLLMClient``/``ProgramExtractionCache``.

**No ``description`` field, with two narrow exceptions.**
``ProgramExtractionResult`` carries no free-form ``description`` output
of its own -- only ``program_name``, ``audience_grades``, ``date_start``,
``date_end``, ``cost``, ``eligibility``, ``is_open``,
``opportunity_type``, and (sprint 029 ticket 006) ``registration_deadline``.
Neither adapter invents a description, with two narrow exceptions, both
computed from the *resolved* ``opportunity_type`` (the config override or
the LLM's own classification, whichever won) inside
:func:`_map_result_to_event`: (sprint 028) a resolved ``"Camps"`` record
with ``result.is_open`` ``False`` gets a sold-out note; (sprint 029
ticket 006) a resolved ``"Competitions"`` record with a non-empty
``result.registration_deadline`` gets a "Registration deadline: ..."
note -- see that function's docstring and ``adapters/DESIGN.md``'s
sprint 028 section and its sprint 029 Revision section (Design
Rationale: "fold ``registration_deadline`` into ``Event.description``").
Every other ``program_kind``/``opportunity_type`` combination still
leaves ``Event.description`` unset.

**A closed page is still emitted.** ``result.is_open is False`` is not
checked here -- filtering "is this program still current" happens at
export time via ``export.writer.is_current_or_upcoming()``, not at
extraction time (see ``normalize/DESIGN.md``'s sprint 027 addendum). This
module's job is only to map the LLM's structured output onto an ``Event``.

**(Sprint 028) HTML-to-text reduction before every cache lookup and LLM
call.** :func:`_extract_one_program`/:func:`_extract_many_programs` call
``extract.reduce_html_to_text(raw.body)`` immediately after the non-200
status check, closing issue 36 -- two verified sprint-027 failures
(the SD Foundation Community Scholarship's 840KB-965KB pages, a 612KB
UCSD Summer Program Finder card) raised
``anthropic.BadRequestError: prompt is too long`` from sending
``raw.body`` to the LLM verbatim. The *reduced* text, not the raw fetched
body, is what gets hashed for the extraction cache key and sent to the
LLM -- a deliberate improvement, not an incidental side effect: a page's
raw HTML changes on every boilerplate edit the reduction step already
discards, so hashing the reduced text avoids invalidating the cache for
changes the LLM never sees. See ``adapters/DESIGN.md``'s sprint 028
section for the full Design Rationale. ``ProgramExtractionCache.
_CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION`` is unchanged -- the entry's on-disk shape is
unchanged, only what gets hashed; a stale stored hash is simply a normal,
harmless cache miss under the cache's existing contract.

    extract+map-to-Event logic once a URL is in hand; only ``discover()``
    differs between them (see this module's docstring, and
    ``generic_html.py``/``listing_html.py``'s identical relationship via
    ``extract.ladder.extract_fields()``).

    A non-200 fetch is logged and skipped (``[]``), matching
    ``listing_html.py``'s convention. Otherwise: ``raw.body`` is first
    reduced to bounded visible text via ``extract.reduce_html_to_text()``
    (sprint 028, issue 36 -- see ``adapters/DESIGN.md``'s sprint 028
    section) -- every downstream step (cache lookup/store, the LLM call)
    uses this *reduced* text, never the raw fetched body, so the
    extraction cache's key is now a hash of the reduced text (a
    deliberate improvement; see that section's Design Rationale). On a
    miss, call the injected ``ProgramLLMClient`` and store the result.
    The source's ``config.program_kind`` (required; ``"internship"`` or
    ``"program"``) sets ``Event.kind`` -- a missing or invalid value is
    logged and skipped, never raised, matching this module's general
    per-record error-isolation stance.

    **(Ticket 006 live-verification finding)** The ``llm_client.
    extract_program()`` call itself is also wrapped: any exception it
    raises (a live UCSD Summer Program Finder card,
    ``www.rmtlacademy.org``, was found to fetch a page whose body alone
    exceeds the model's context window, raising
    ``anthropic.BadRequestError``) is logged and treated as a skip for
    this one ref, never left to propagate. Without this,
    ``adapters.base.run()``'s fetch/extract loop has no per-ref
    try/except of its own (by design -- see ``Adapter.extract()``'s own
    docstring: isolation is each adapter's job), so one oversized page
    would abort the *entire* source, discarding every other already-
    fetched card's ``Event`` along with it -- for a ``program_listing``
    source with 20+ cards, one bad card would otherwise zero out the
    whole run. Mirrors ``enrich/enricher.py``'s identical "any exception
    the call raises, not only a specific error type" fail-open stance for
    its own LLM call. **(Sprint 028)** the HTML-reduction step above is
    what now keeps that same oversized page from raising in the first
    place, for the common case; this per-ref isolation remains as the
    backstop for whatever still doesn't fit.

    all inline prose on one page, not links to N separate detail pages --
    a shape ``ProgramListingAdapter``'s card-to-detail-page model has no
