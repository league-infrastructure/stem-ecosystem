"""The pluggable Adapter contract and dispatch registry.

See sprint.md's Architecture > Adapter Framework: every source is
turned into canonical Events via a per-``adapter_type`` strategy that
implements ``discover -> fetch -> extract``, chained by the generic
:func:`run` below. ``discover()`` is deliberately part of the contract
even though every structured-API adapter this sprint (``tec_rest``, and
``wp_rest``/``ical`` in ticket 005) resolves it trivially against the
source's own endpoint -- this is the seam sprint 2's sitemap-diff and
generic-HTML adapters implement with real "find URLs" logic, without
any change to this module (sprint.md's Deferred Seams).

Registering a new adapter type is a one-line addition to :data:`ADAPTERS`
(done in ``adapters/__init__.py``, e.g. ``ADAPTERS["tec_rest"] =
TecRestAdapter``) -- never a change to :func:`run` or :func:`get_adapter`.

    exactly how many refs it discovered and how many were dropped.

    **(Ticket 006 exception revision)** A zero-discovered-refs result is
