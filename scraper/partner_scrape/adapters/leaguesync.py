"""The League's own sync.jtlapp.net query API adapter (``leaguesync``).

The League of Amazing Programmers runs its own read-only query API
(``sync.jtlapp.net``) over its Pike13 (classes/courses) and Meetup
(free tech clubs) data. This is now the authoritative source for
League classes -- the previous ``generic_html`` scrape of
jointheleague.org/classes (``registry/sources/jointheleague.toml``,
now disabled) could get titles/descriptions but never real schedules
or dates, since jointheleague.org's public pages don't publish
occurrence dates -- only Pike13's booking widget does, and this API
exposes exactly that.

Two logical pulls, both against the same ``GET /query?sql=<SELECT>``
endpoint, distinguished via each ``EventRef.context["kind"]`` set by
``discover()`` and read back by ``extract()`` (see ``base.py``'s
``EventRef`` docstring -- this is exactly the "distinguish what a ref
is for" use ``context`` exists for):

1. CLASSES -- one canonical ``Event`` per qualifying ``services`` row,
   built from that service's *next* upcoming ``event_occurrences`` row
   (earliest ``start_at >= now``, computed server-side by
   :data:`CLASSES_SQL`'s window function -- one row per service in the
   result, no client-side grouping needed).
2. TECH_CLUBS -- one ``Event`` per upcoming, active ``meetup_events``
   row (the League's free FTC/robotics tech clubs), left-joined to
   ``meetup_venues`` for location.

Every field this adapter sets is high-trust -- like ``tec_rest`` and
``localist``, this is a structured, first-party API (the League's own
sync of its own Pike13/Meetup data), so every ``Event.set(...)`` call
below uses :data:`CONFIDENCE` (1.0).

Every ``Event`` this adapter emits also sets ``Event.trusted = True``
(OOP, 2026-07-20): live-observed that the LLM relevance gate
(``enrich/enricher.py``) dropped real League youth classes with thin
titles ("Summer Camps@SFA", "Python@GA") as apparently not-relevant.
The League's own beta site requires all of its curated youth
programming to show regardless of that verdict -- ``trusted`` tells the
Enricher to still classify the Event (areas/age/cost still wanted) but
never let the relevance gate drop it. Because the gate can no longer
catch a wrongly-included non-youth service, :data:`CLASSES_SQL` itself
excludes teacher/staff/professional-development services (see its own
comment) -- the SQL filter is the only thing standing between a
"Teacher Development" service and the parent-facing site once
``trusted`` is set.

Auth: the API requires ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` (see
``config.get_leaguesync_api_key()``) -- passed as an explicit
``headers`` argument to ``fetcher.get()`` on every fetch, per the
``Fetcher`` protocol (``fetch/fetcher.py``). Query text (not the token)
is embedded directly in the URL as ``?sql=<url-encoded SELECT>``, per
sync.jtlapp.net's own contract -- SELECT/WITH only, no mutation
possible even if the URL were logged.

#: per service" grouping server-side, so extract() never needs to
#: dedupe multiple occurrence rows per service itself.
#:
#: Filters match sprint.md's confirmed WANT clause: service_type IN
#: ('Course','GroupClass') (excludes 1:1 'Appointment' bookings, not
#: public classes), visitors_can_view=1, deleted_at IS NULL for both
#: the service and its chosen occurrence. eo.state='active' additionally
#: excludes canceled occurrences (confirmed live: 6 of 356 near-term
#: occurrences are state='canceled') from ever being picked as "next".
#:
#: Teacher/staff/professional-development exclusion (OOP, 2026-07-20):
#: confirmed live that "Teacher Development" (a staff-facing service,
#: not a youth class) otherwise passes every filter above and -- once
#: `Event.trusted` bypasses the LLM relevance gate -- would surface on
#: the parent-facing site with no downstream check to catch it. Excluded
#: here, at the source, on both `s.name` and `s.category_name` so it
#: never becomes an Event at all; kept to the specific
#: Teacher/Staff/Professional Development vocabulary (not e.g. a bare
#: "%Staff%" alone) so a legitimate class that happens to mention staff
#: in passing isn't accidentally excluded.
