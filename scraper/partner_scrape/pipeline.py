"""Pipeline/CLI orchestration: wires Registry -> Adapters -> Normalize -> Export.

See sprint.md's Architecture > Pipeline/CLI: this module's whole job is
sequencing the business logic each other module already owns --
enumerate active Source Registry entries (ticket 002), dispatch each to
its adapter via the ticket 004/005 dispatch registry, run the (currently
empty) `Enricher` hook over the collected Events, hand the result to
`normalize.run()` (ticket 006), then to `export.export_opportunities()`
(ticket 007). If this file grows business logic of its own beyond
sequencing + per-source error isolation, that is a sign a responsibility
leaked out of its owning module and belongs there instead -- the "must
not become a god component" check sprint.md's self-review pre-justified.

Per-source error isolation (SUC-008's Error Flow: "One source's adapter
raises -> logged, run continues with remaining sources, non-zero sources
still produce output") is this module's one piece of real logic: each
source's `adapters.run(source, fetcher)` call is wrapped in its own
try/except inside the enumeration loop, not around the whole batch --
distinct from ticket 004's per-*record* isolation inside a single
adapter's own `extract()`.

Sprint 003 ticket 005 adds this module's other piece of real logic:
per-source `Fetcher` selection. Each source's
`acquisition_policy.get("fetch_strategy", "static")` (registry/schema.py,
also ticket 005) picks between the run's one default `Fetcher` (as
before this ticket) and a headless-wrapping `Fetcher` -- `PoliteFetcher`
wrapping `PlaywrightFetcher` (`fetch/headless.py`, ticket 001), built
lazily via `headless_fetcher_factory` at most once per `run()` call, and
only if at least one active source actually needs it. See sprint.md's
Design Rationale ("Headless fetch strategy is selected by Pipeline...")
-- no `Adapter` implementation, existing or future, needs to know
headless fetching exists; this module is the only one that ever
constructs a headless `Fetcher`.

#: for a full crawl once the registry grew past ~30 sources; the 1
#: req/sec per-domain rate limit was the wall-clock bottleneck, not any
#: real per-run concurrency ceiling) and still polite (no domain is ever
#: hit faster than its own configured `rate_limit_seconds`, regardless
#: of how many *other* domains are being fetched at the same instant).

#: own sync API additionally expects to be driven from one consistent
#: thread. Routing every `headless`-strategy source through its own
#: single-worker `ThreadPoolExecutor`, instead of the main
#: `DEFAULT_MAX_SOURCE_WORKERS`-worker one, is what guarantees both:
#: strictly one `_run_one_source` call in flight at a time for a

        ads_dir: directory of hand-authored ad-config TOML files (Ad
            Content Export, sprint 005 ticket 005). Defaults to the real
            bundled ad registry (or `$PARTNER_SCRAPE_REGISTRY_DIR/ads`) when
            omitted -- see `export.ads.load_ad_configs`. Tests that don't
            care about the exact seeded ad content may pass an explicit
            fixture directory here.
        fetcher: the `Fetcher` each source flagged `static` (the
            registry default, `acquisition_policy.fetch_strategy` unset
            or `"static"`) retrieves raw content through. Defaults to a

            on-disk cache under `$SCRAPE_CACHE_DIR`) when omitted -- the
            production path. Tests inject a fixture `Fetcher` here so

            flagged `acquisition_policy.fetch_strategy = "headless"`
            retrieves raw content through. Called at most once per
            `run()` call -- lazily, only when the first `headless`-
            flagged active source is reached -- and its return value is
            reused for every subsequent `headless`-flagged source in
            the same run. Defaults to `_build_default_headless_fetcher`
            (a real `PoliteFetcher` wrapping a real `PlaywrightFetcher`)
            when omitted -- the production path. Tests inject a factory

            wrapping `PlaywrightFetcher(page_factory=...)` with a
            fixture `page_factory`, ticket 001's DI seam), or a bare
            spy/counter, so no run needs a real browser or the optional
            `playwright` dependency.
        enrichers: an ordered sequence of `Enricher`s applied to the
            collected Event stream before normalization. Empty by
            default (see `Enricher`'s docstring).
        reporter: an optional observability hook, called once per
            source (both branches of the per-source try/except) and
            once after normalization with the final `Opportunity`
            list. Defaults to a no-op when omitted -- see `Reporter`'s
            docstring.
        partners_path: path to the site's `partners.json`. Defaults to
            `{site_dir}/src/data/partners.json` (sprint.md's documented
            location) when omitted.
        source_id: when given, run only the active source whose
            `source_id` matches (the registry TOML file's stem) -- the
            CLI's `--source` flag.
        limit: when given, run only the first `limit` active sources
            (after any `source_id` filter) -- the CLI's `--limit` flag.
        today: the reference date for Site Export's current/upcoming
            filter. Defaults to `date.today()` when omitted (via
            `export_opportunities`). Tests should pass an explicit value
            for determinism.
        dry_run: when `True`, compute and return the would-be-written
            export payload without touching disk (`export_opportunities`
            and `export_ads` both respect this the same way).
        max_source_workers: how many active sources' discover -> fetch ->
            extract chains (`adapters.run`) run concurrently, across a
            bounded `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Defaults to
            `DEFAULT_MAX_SOURCE_WORKERS` (8) -- see that constant's own
            docstring for why source-level concurrency is both fast and
            still polite (politeness is enforced per-DOMAIN, by the
            shared `Fetcher`(s)' `Throttle`, not per-run). `1` runs
            every source strictly sequentially, in registry order, on
            the calling thread -- byte-for-byte the same code path
            `run()` used before this parameter existed (no
            `ThreadPoolExecutor` is even constructed), so existing
            callers that care about exact sequential timing/ordering
            can pin it. Regardless of this value, every source's
            events are accumulated into the final `events` list, and
            every `reporter.record_source(...)` call is made, in the
            registry's own source order -- never completion order --
            so a run's output is identical (same events, same order,
            same reported data) no matter how many workers processed
            it or in what order they happened to finish.
        image_resolver: the `image_url -> local filename` callable
            `normalize_run()` uses to populate `Opportunity.image_src`
            (sprint 008 ticket 008, issue 19). Defaults to `None`, which
            makes `run()` construct a real
            `export.images.EventImageDownloader` writing into
            the data Store's `images/opportunities/` prefix (sprint 025
            ticket 002; before that ticket, this wrote into
            `{resolved site_dir}/public/images/opportunities/` instead) --
            *unless* `dry_run` is `True`, in which case no downloader is
            constructed and `image_src` simply stays `""` for every
            record, matching `export_opportunities`'/`export_ads`'s own
            "computes without touching disk" `dry_run` contract
            (downloading and writing image files is itself a disk write
            this parameter must not perform during a dry run). Tests
            inject a fixture-backed callable (or `lambda _: ""`) here so
            no test touches a real socket; every existing caller/test
            that omits this parameter and never sets `Event.image_url`
            is completely unaffected either way, since
            `EventImageDownloader.download()` makes no network call at
            all for an empty `image_url` (see that class's docstring).

    Returns:
        The list of opportunity dicts that were (or, for `dry_run`,
        would have been) written -- `export_opportunities`'s return
        value, passed through unchanged. `export_ads()` is also called
        (writing/returning `ads.json`'s payload as a side effect) but its
        return value is not part of `run()`'s own return value -- this
        keeps every existing caller/test that only cares about
        opportunities unaffected by this addition.
