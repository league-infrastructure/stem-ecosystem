"""Headless Fetcher: ``PlaywrightFetcher``, retrieving one URL's fully
client-rendered HTML via a real headless browser.

See sprint.md's Architecture > Headless Fetcher: ``PlaywrightFetcher``
implements the exact same ``Fetcher.get(url, headers=None) ->
FetchResponse`` contract ``fetch/fetcher.py``'s ``UrllibFetcher``
does, so it drops into ``PoliteFetcher``'s existing ``fetcher=``
constructor parameter (``fetch/cache.py``) with zero changes to
``PoliteFetcher``, ``fetch/robots.py``, or ``fetch/throttle.py`` -- no
adapter or discovery module ever needs to know headless fetching
exists (Pipeline, ticket 005, is the only module that constructs this
class).

**Critical constraint**: ``playwright`` is an optional dependency
group (``pyproject.toml``: ``[project.optional-dependencies] headless
= ["playwright>=1.40"]``), never a base dependency. The real ``import
playwright`` call is deferred all the way into
:func:`_default_page_factory`, which only runs on the first real
(non-fixture) call to :meth:`PlaywrightFetcher.get` -- never at module
import time, never in ``__init__``. Tests inject a fixture
``page_factory`` (matching this repo's existing ``Fetcher``/
``LLMClient`` DI pattern -- see ``fetch/fetcher.py`` and
``enrich/llm_client.py`` -- applied one level deeper here, since the
*dependency itself*, not just the network call, must be avoidable) and
so never trigger that import; the whole default test suite runs with
``playwright`` fully uninstalled.

**(Sprint 014)** ``PlaywrightFetcher.get()`` holds an instance-owned
``threading.Lock`` for its whole duration -- page construction
(:meth:`_get_page`) through :meth:`HeadlessPage.content`. This is
defense in depth, not the load-bearing guarantee: a single shared
Playwright ``Page`` is not safe for concurrent navigation from
multiple threads, and Playwright's own sync API additionally expects
to be driven from one consistent thread, which a bare lock cannot by
itself guarantee (a lock serializes *when* calls run, not *which*
thread runs them). The load-bearing guarantee -- every call to a
given shared instance originates from one consistent thread for a
run's lifetime -- is provided by ``pipeline.py``'s dedicated
single-worker executor for ``headless``-strategy sources. See
``fetch/DESIGN.md``'s sprint 014 section and
``partner_scrape/DESIGN.md``'s new concurrency convention for the
full rationale.

#: newly-flagged Wix sources found that strategy times out for 8 of 8
#: real Wix homepage fetches -- these sites keep a persistent
#: background connection (analytics/chat widget) open indefinitely, so
#: the network never truly idles, even though the real content
#: finishes rendering well within a second. ``get()`` now passes
#: ``wait_until="load"`` instead (a strictly less strict, still
#: standard Playwright wait condition; content already reflects the
#: fully hydrated page by the time ``load`` fires for every site
#: tested). This constant still bounds that wait -- same value, same
#: role, different condition -- kept as one name/one constant (no new
#: per-source config surface) per this ticket's own scope boundary.

#: or aborts navigation outright with ``net::ERR_ABORTED`` (observed
#: live: 4 more sources) -- see issue 37 (sprint 015) and
#: ``fetch/DESIGN.md``'s sprint 015 section. There is no real
#: ``Content-Type`` to inspect before a request is made, so this is
#: necessarily a URL heuristic, not a response-header one.
#:
#: Deliberately excludes ``.txt``: ``fetch/robots.py`` fetches
#: ``robots.txt`` through this same ``get()`` for every source
#: (headless or not), and that path is untouched, evidenced-bug-free
#: territory this ticket's scope does not extend to (see the ticket's
#: "no ``robots.py`` changes" boundary) -- adding ``.txt`` here would

        for the live evidence.

        ``status`` on the returned ``FetchResponse`` is always taken
        from the real navigation (or raw) response -- never hardcoded --
