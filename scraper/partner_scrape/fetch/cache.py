"""Response cache (over a ``Store``), conditional-GET header construction,
and the ``PoliteFetcher`` orchestrator.

Cache layout: one JSON object per URL, host-sharded --
``hosts/{hostname}/{sha256(url)}.json`` in the scrape-cache Store --
containing ``{url, status, headers, body, fetched_at}``. One file per URL keeps the
format simple enough to inspect by hand, which matters for debugging a
live source later (see sprint.md's Implementation Plan for this
ticket).

``PoliteFetcher`` is this package's public entry point: it composes an
injectable ``Fetcher`` with a robots.txt check, per-domain rate
limiting, and this cache, in the order SUC-002's Main Flow describes.
Ticket 004's adapters call ``PoliteFetcher.get(...)`` and never touch
``UrllibFetcher``, ``Throttle``, or these cache functions directly.

class PoliteFetcher:
    """Fetch & Cache's public entry point: robots.txt + rate limit + cache.

    Composes an injectable ``Fetcher`` (defaults to ``UrllibFetcher``)
    with a robots.txt permission check, a per-domain ``Throttle``, and
    a conditional-GET cache over a ``Store``: ``cache_dir`` (wrapped in a
    ``LocalStore``) when given, else ``config.get_scrape_cache_store()``.

    ``rate_limit_seconds`` and ``respect_robots`` are accepted per call
    as plain values rather than read from a ``SourceConfig`` here --
    this module has no dependency on the Registry (see sprint.md's
    Component & Dependency Diagram: Fetch & Cache depends only on
    Config). Callers that have a ``SourceConfig`` (ticket 004's
    adapters) pull the values out of its ``acquisition_policy`` dict
    themselves.

    ``cache_dir`` defaults to ``config.get_scrape_cache_store()`` when
    omitted -- the "FETCH reads cache dir from CFG" edge in sprint.md's
    dependency diagram. Tests always pass ``cache_dir`` explicitly (a
    ``tmp_path``) or monkeypatch ``SCRAPE_CACHE_DIR`` first; neither
    path ever touches the real configured cache directory.

    Thread-safety: one ``PoliteFetcher`` instance is shared across every
    worker thread in the pipeline's source-level concurrency (every
    ``static``-strategy source uses the same instance; every
    ``headless``-strategy source shares one more). ``self.throttle`` is
    already safe to call concurrently (see ``Throttle``'s own
    docstring). The on-disk cache is keyed by ``sha256(url)``, so two
    different URLs -- even fetched by two different threads at the same
    instant -- always write to two different files and never collide.
    The one real hazard is two threads fetching the *same* URL at the
    same time (e.g. two sources that happen to reference an identical
    URL): both would read (``read_cache_entry``), and then
    read-then-write (``touch_fetch_timestamp``) or write
    (``write_cache_entry``), the same file concurrently. Two concurrent
    writes could interleave two partial writes into one corrupted JSON
    file; worse, a plain read can land in the middle of a write (which
    truncates the file to zero bytes before writing a single new byte)
    and raise ``json.JSONDecodeError`` instead of a normal cache-miss
    ``None``. ``_cache_lock`` serializes every one of this file's reads
    and writes against each other -- not the network fetch or the
    throttle wait, which stay fully concurrent across domains -- so a
    same-URL race can, at worst, read stale data or write the same file
    twice in a row, never observe or produce a corrupted one.
