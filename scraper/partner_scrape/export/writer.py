"""`export_opportunities()`: the Site Export module's single entry point.

Publishes already-normalized `Opportunity` records (produced by
`partner_scrape.normalize.run`, ticket 006) into partner-scrape's own
the data Store (`config.get_data_store()`; sprint.md Architecture > Site Export, SUC-007). This
module does not re-derive or re-map any field -- its only
responsibilities are:

1. Filter to current + upcoming records (historical data never ships).
2. A defensive slug-uniqueness pass (normalize already dedupes by
   title+date+venue, but distinct records can still collide on the
   truncated slug -- e.g. same org+title on nearby dates truncated the
   same way).
3. Serialize exactly the site schema's field set -- dropping
   `Opportunity.sources`, which is normalize's own cross-source
   bookkeeping and not part of `stem-ecosystem/docs/site-implementation
   -spec.md`'s Opportunities table.
4. Write `opportunities.json` and `scrape-meta.json` into
   the data Store, matching `dev/export_site.py`'s original behavior
   and file shapes exactly.

Sprint 020 ticket 003 (issue 60) added a second write target,
partner-scrape's own data location (since sprint 038 the data Store,
`config.get_data_store()`, by default the bucket's `data/` prefix),
alongside the original write into a sibling `stem-ecosystem` checkout's
`src/data/` -- "one export, three files, two directories" -- so this
repo's own pipeline output was inspectable without a
`stem-ecosystem` checkout on hand. Sprint 025 ticket 003 (issue 21,
"stop writing to the stem-ecosystem checkout") removed the
`stem-ecosystem` write entirely: this function no longer accepts a
`site_dir` parameter, and the data location is now the sole write target.

A missing local data directory is created automatically; an unwritable
one fails loudly -- SUC-007's explicit error flow is "fail loudly, do not
silently skip the export."
