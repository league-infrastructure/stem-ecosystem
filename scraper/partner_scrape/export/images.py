"""`EventImageDownloader`: the Event Image Downloader module.

Sprint 008 ticket 008 (issue 19, scraper half; see sprint.md Architecture
> Step 3 "Event Image Downloader" and Step 4's diagram). Given one
`Event`'s already-extracted `image_url` -- populated by the Extraction
Ladder's JSON-LD/OpenGraph rungs (`extract/ladder.py`) or by one of four
adapters (`leaguesync`, `localist`, `bibliocommons`, `tec`) -- this
module fetches it, validates it is really an image, quality-gates it
(rejects tracking pixels/spacers/undersized/non-image responses), dedupes
identical images across events, and self-hosts a local copy. No new
extraction is added here (sprint.md's Out of Scope); this module only
turns an already-populated remote URL into a self-hosted file in the data Store (key prefix `images/opportunities/`).

`pipeline.run()` wires one `EventImageDownloader` instance per export run
into `normalize.run()` via the `image_resolver` callable parameter (a
plain `Callable[[str], str]`, not an import of this class) -- keeping
`normalize` free of any dependency on `export`, matching sprint.md's
documented one-way module-dependency direction ("Export ... depends
one-way on Normalize"; the new edge is Export -> this module, not
Normalize -> this module). `normalize.run.Opportunity.image_src` ends up
holding this call's return value, exported automatically by
`export/writer.py`'s `SITE_SCHEMA_FIELDS` (no writer.py edit needed).

## Quality gate

A call to `.download(image_url)` rejects (returns `""`) at the first of:

1. `image_url` is empty, blank, or not `http(s)://` -- never even
   attempts a fetch (`file://`/`data:`/other schemes are refused before
   any I/O, matching sprint.md's Migration Concern that a downloaded
   asset "must not execute or interpret the downloaded bytes as anything
   other than a static image asset").
2. The HTTP response is not 2xx, or its body is empty.
3. Its `Content-Type` header, when present, does not start with
   `image/`.
4. The body exceeds `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` -- a size-safety cap.
5. The body does not structurally decode as a real PNG, JPEG, GIF, or
   WebP (see `_sniff_dimensions`) -- this is this module's "real
   image-decode check" (sprint.md's Migration Concern: "verify the
   fetched response is actually an image ... not just a URL pattern"),
   catching non-image content masquerading with an image Content-Type,
   truncated downloads, and HTML error pages.
6. The decoded width or height is below `MIN_DIMENSION` pixels --
   rejects 1x1 tracking pixels and small spacer graphics.

Survivors are deduped by SHA-256 of their raw bytes: an image already
stored earlier in the same `EventImageDownloader`'s lifetime (the common
case of a generic partner-site banner reused across many unrelated
events, sprint.md Approach step 2) reuses its existing filename rather
than writing a duplicate file.

**Resize-on-fetch (sprint 025 ticket 002).** Pixel-dimension downscaling
was intentionally *not* implemented as of ticket 008 -- this docstring's
own earlier text named the exact trigger for revisiting that call ("if
genuine pixel downscaling becomes a real operational need, revisit
adding an image-processing dependency in a follow-up ticket"). Sprint
025's own measurement of stem-ecosystem's 631 already-self-hosted images
was that trigger: ~405MB total, mean 655KB/median 303KB, 147 files over
1MB accounting for 67% of total bytes (including a 5.2MB
raw-camera-original JPEG served as a card thumbnail). `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`
bounds the *fetched* payload but was never a substitute for true
resampling of what gets *stored*.

A newly-downloaded image (only -- the 631 legacy images already
self-hosted before this ticket are explicitly out of scope; this module
never re-processes an already-stored file) whose long edge exceeds
`RESIZE_LONG_EDGE` is downscaled, aspect ratio preserved, via Pillow's
`Image.thumbnail`, and re-encoded: JPEG at `RESIZE_JPEG_QUALITY` for an
opaque image, PNG for one with an alpha channel (so transparency isn't
silently lost). GIF is passed through unresized regardless of size --
`Image.thumbnail` only touches a GIF's first frame, which would silently
drop animation. An image already within the cap on both dimensions is
written through unchanged, byte-for-byte -- no unnecessary re-encode.
See `_resize_if_needed`.

This is the one exception to `fetch/fetcher.py`'s "zero new
dependencies" rationale (echoed in this module's own `UrllibImageFetcher`
docstring, which still holds for *fetching*): this module now takes a
hard dependency on Pillow (`pyproject.toml`'s `dependencies`, not an
optional extra like `playwright` -- no external browser/binary is
needed).

A missing, unreachable, or rejected image never raises -- `.download()`
returns `""`, and the caller leaves `Opportunity.image_src` empty,
exactly SUC-008's documented Alternate Flow ("the record exports
normally otherwise").
