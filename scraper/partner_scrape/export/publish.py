"""`publish.project()`: the build-time projection into partner-scrape's
own data tree (the data Store).

`export/partner_log.py` (ticket 003) accumulates every `Opportunity`
ever seen into a durable, per-partner, append-only `.jsonl` log. That
log is not itself a publishable contract -- it can hold several lines
for the same event (one per content change) and is keyed only by
whatever partners happened to yield opportunities on some past run. This
module turns that accumulated state into issue 15's actual public data
contract: a partner roster (`{own_data_dir}/partners.json`) plus, per
partner, a current/upcoming events file and a past-events file.

Sprint 025 ticket 007 (issue 21, "stop writing to the stem-ecosystem
checkout") redirected this projection's write target from
`{site_dir}/public/data/` to partner-scrape's own data location
(since sprint 038 the data Store, `config.get_data_store()`), matching every other sprint-020 export
module's convention -- for stem-ecosystem (or any consumer) to pull
from at its own build time, rather than partner-scrape writing directly
into a sibling checkout. `site_dir` stays as a parameter: it still
resolves the default `partners_path` (the curated roster this
projection reads and joins against), which this ticket leaves
untouched.

## Self-describing, not just "correct"

Issue 15's whole point is that a consumer needs *no other data source*
to reconstruct the site: no source code, no separately-communicated
schema, no tribal knowledge of file layout. So every published file
here carries a small metadata envelope alongside its data --
`generated_at`, a `partner_count`/`event_count`, and (for partners.json)
each partner's own reference paths to its two event files -- rather
than shipping a bare, unlabeled array and assuming the reader already
knows what it is or where to look next.

## What this module does not do

Reuses `writer.is_current_or_upcoming` for the current/past split and
`writer.SITE_SCHEMA_FIELDS`/`writer.to_json_dict` for the event field
set -- the exact same promoted helpers `export_opportunities` uses, so
the two published contracts (`opportunities.json` and this module's
`own_data_dir` tree) can never silently disagree about which events are
current or what an event record contains. This module adds no new
judgment on top of those -- see `export/DESIGN.md`.

## One-way dependency on `partner_log.py`

This module imports exactly one thing from `partner_log.py`: the
`.jsonl` filename constant (`_JSONL_FILENAME`), so the two modules'
notion of "where the log lives" cannot drift apart. It does not import
`partner_log.record` or duplicate its slug-computation logic to
*enumerate* partners -- partners come from the curated `partners.json`
(via `model.slugify`, the same shared primitive), not from listing
`log_dir`'s subdirectories. `partner_log.py` never imports this module
-- the dependency is one-way, matching this subsystem's existing
`mirror.py` -> `writer.py`/`ads.py` convention.

## Read-cost note (not solved here)

`project()` reads and parses *every* partner's full `.jsonl` on every
call -- cost grows with total accumulated history, not with one run's
yield, since `partner_log.py` never prunes. Negligible while the store
is young; flagged in `export/DESIGN.md`'s Open Questions as worth
re-measuring later, not solved speculatively here.

            anywhere under `site_dir`. Defaults to `config.get_site_dir()`

        log_dir: root of the per-partner accumulation store

            the scrape-cache Store's `partner_log/` prefix
            (`partner_log.resolve_log_store`).
        partners_path: path to the curated `partners.json` this
            projection joins against. Defaults to
            `{site_dir}/src/data/partners.json` -- note this is a
            different file from the `{own_data_dir}/partners.json` this
            function writes (see `export/DESIGN.md`'s Open Questions on
            the naming overlap).
        own_data_dir: where to write -- a local path, an `s3://` location,
            or a `Store`; this function's sole write target. Defaults to
            `config.get_data_store()` when `None`. A local directory is
            created automatically if missing. Tests should always pass
            an explicit `tmp_path` here, never rely on the default.
        today: reference date for the current/past split. Defaults to
            `date.today()`. Tests should pass an explicit value.
        dry_run: when `True`, compute and return the summary without
            touching disk at all.
