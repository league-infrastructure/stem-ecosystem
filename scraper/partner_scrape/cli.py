"""``partner-scrape``: the aggregator engine's command-line entry point.

A thin `argparse` wrapper around `pipeline.run()` (sprint.md Architecture
> Pipeline/CLI) -- this module owns flag parsing and console output only;
every real decision (which sources, which adapters, what gets written)
belongs to `pipeline.run()` and the modules it calls. Registered as the
`partner-scrape` console script in `pyproject.toml`.

Ticket 004 (sprint 005) adds the `discover-candidates` subcommand,
dispatching to `discovery.candidate_pipeline.discover_candidates()` --
structurally separate from (and never calling into) the `run` command's
`pipeline.run()` path, per sprint.md's Design Rationale ("Hub scanning is
structurally separate from the Event/Opportunity pipeline"). It is
purely additive: every existing flag, default, and printed line of the
no-subcommand/`run` invocation is unchanged.

Ticket 002 (sprint 011) adds the `teams` subcommand, dispatching to
`teams.pipeline.run_teams()` -- structurally separate from (and never
calling into) the `run` command's `pipeline.run()` path, for the same
reason as `discover-candidates` plus one more: rosters refresh
annually while opportunities refresh weekly, and a future TBA
credential failure (ticket 011-003) must never sit inside `run`'s own
process/exit code. Also purely additive.

Ticket 007 (sprint 018) adds the `directory` subcommand, dispatching to
`directory.pipeline.run_directory()` -- structurally separate from (and
never calling into) `run`'s or `teams`'s own paths, for the same
"disjoint standing-data pipeline" reasoning as `teams` above. One
subcommand covers both Places (ticket 007) and Clubs (ticket 018-008,
the sprint's Hack Club chapters proof of concept), per sprint.md's Open
Questions recommendation ("one directory command ... mirrors teams"),
rather than a second subcommand -- `directory.pipeline.run_directory()`
itself is where ticket 018-008 added its Club dispatch, not a new CLI
subcommand or CLI flag. Also purely additive: this subcommand's own
flags, defaults, and printed output shape are unchanged by ticket
018-008 beyond reporting a clubs count alongside the places count.
