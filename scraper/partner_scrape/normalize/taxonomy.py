"""Controlled-vocabulary taxonomy derivation: text/value -> site-schema tags.

Ports `dev/export_site.py`'s `AREA_KEYWORDS` / `AGE_KEYWORDS` /
`map_cost` / `map_time_of_day` keyword-rule sets (ticket 006's
Description) into pure functions, reimplemented against the canonical
`Event` shape rather than that script's flat dict -- see
`derive_time_of_day`'s docstring for the one behavioral reimplementation
(reading `Event.start`'s real `datetime` instead of re-parsing a text
time string). No LLM this sprint (issue 04, sprint 2+); see sprint.md's
Architecture > Normalize & Dedup.

Every function here takes plain text/values, not an `Event` -- building
the input blob from an `Event`'s fields is run.py's job (via
:func:`build_taxonomy_text`), keeping this module a pure "text/value in,
tags out" layer that's trivial to unit test standalone.

Behavior matches `dev/export_site.py`'s rules on the same inputs
(spot-checked, not required to be byte-identical) per the ticket's
acceptance criteria.

#: `opportunity_type` classification rules, checked in order (first match
#: wins), mapping to the site's controlled vocabulary.
#:
#: These are matched against the event TITLE ONLY, deliberately. Matching
#: descriptions produced badly wrong results in practice: "Bird Walk at
#: Grant Park" and half the Anza-Borrego hikes classified as "Funding
#: Opportunities" (the word "grant"), and any event whose blurb said
#: "led by volunteers" became "Volunteering". A title is a curated,
#: high-signal label; a description is prose full of incidental words.
#:
#: Only high-confidence signals are encoded -- anything unmatched keeps
#: the `DEFAULT_OPPORTUNITY_TYPE` rather than being force-fit into a
#: bucket. There is deliberately NO "Funding Opportunities" rule: an
#: events calendar carries events, not grant announcements, and every
#: keyword for it (grant/scholarship/fellowship) is a false-positive
#: magnet. Bare "school" is likewise avoided -- it matches the
#: "preschool"/"school-age" AUDIENCE terms -- so phrases are used.
#:
#: Sprint 015 (ticket 006, issue 27): `"Camps"` gets a rule (see below).
#: `"Competitions"` deliberately does NOT -- same rationale as
#: `"Funding Opportunities"` above. The obvious keyword candidate,
#: `competit*` (competition/competitive), false-positives on a real,
#: already-fixtured title: `tests/test_adapters_leaguesync.py`'s
#: "Competitive Robotics Summer Warm Up" is a League *class* (kind
#: "event", ordinary registration-based instruction), not a
#: competition -- exactly the "common word appears in unrelated
#: program text" failure mode that killed the "grant" keyword. Other
#: candidates (`tournament`, `hackathon`, `fair`) either do not appear
#: anywhere in this codebase's fixtures/adapters to spot-check against,
#: or (`fair` alone) are already too ambiguous -- county fair, health
#: fair, book fair, and `career fair`/`job fair`/`college fair` (already
#: claimed by the Career Connections rule below) all share the bare
#: word. "Competitions" is LLM-only; the keyword fallback keeps
#: defaulting ambiguous titles to `DEFAULT_OPPORTUNITY_TYPE`, the safer
#: failure mode during an LLM outage.
#:
#: Internships are handled separately by kind in normalize/run.py (they
#: force "Work-based Learning") and never reach this function.
