"""The Generic HTML Extractor: a fixed priority ladder of field strategies.

See ``sprint.md``'s Architecture > Generic HTML Extractor, SUC-010. Given
one arbitrary event page's raw HTML and its URL, :func:`extract_fields`
tries a fixed sequence of extraction strategies ("rungs") in priority
order -- JSON-LD ``Event`` schema, ``<time datetime>`` elements,
OpenGraph meta tags, an h1/``<title>`` fallback, URL/slug-embedded date
patterns, and body-text date regex -- each rung filling only the
canonical ``Event`` fields still missing from an earlier, higher-trust
rung. The h1/``<title>`` fallback is not one of the five rungs
``sprint.md``'s Description names explicitly, but every rung after
JSON-LD/OpenGraph needs *some* source for ``title`` or the record would
be dropped for having none -- this ports the equivalent step from
``dev/extract_events.py``'s ``extract_generic`` (its step 4) rather than
inventing new behavior.

This module returns field values + a confidence tier per field, never an
``Event`` -- constructing the canonical record is the ``generic_html``
Adapter's job (``adapters/generic_html.py``), not this one's (sprint.md's
Design Rationale on why the Extractor and the Adapter are separate
modules).

Ported from ``dev/extract_events.py``'s proven logic (``extract_json_ld``,
``extract_time_elements``, ``extract_generic``, and the useful
site-agnostic parts of its BiblioCommons/Drupal/title-date extractors) as
ladder strategies in this one module -- not bespoke per-site scripts
(this ticket's Scope). Uses ``lxml`` for HTML parsing, already a
declared ``partner_scrape`` dependency since sprint 001.

    lxml's built-in ``text_content()`` includes script/style text by
    default -- on real pages this burns a large share of any fixed scan
    window on invisible CSS/JS text before any genuine content (ticket
    003's finding: one sampled page's first ~700 characters of "body
    text" were raw inline CSS rule bodies like
    ``.btnlinks { background: #249a8c; ... }``, never visible to a real
    reader). A hidden element's *tail* text -- content immediately after
    its closing tag -- is still visible and is still yielded.

    Also excludes HTML comment (and processing-instruction) nodes --
    confirmed necessary during this rung's live testing (sprint 007
    ticket 004): ``lxml``'s tree iteration yields ``Comment`` nodes as
    ordinary children, and a ``Comment`` node's ``.text`` holds its
    *entire* raw comment body (unlike ``text_content()``, which already
    knows to skip these). Without this check, a genuinely commented-out
    widget (e.g. SDNHM's dead "From the blog" sidebar block ticket 003
    found, which also turned out to be a live, un-commented, sitewide
    placeholder widget with a static 2015 date on most other SDNHM
    pages) would have its buried text mistaken for real page content.
    ``Comment``/processing-instruction nodes are the only ``lxml``
    node kinds whose ``.tag`` is not a plain string -- that is the
    general, element-name-independent test used here.

    A skipped node (hidden element or comment/PI) yields a single space
    in place of its excluded content, rather than nothing -- defensive
    against gluing two visible text fragments together into a false
    regex match that never existed in the original markup (e.g. visible
    text ending "...March " immediately followed by a ``<script>`` tag
    and then visible text starting "5, 2020..." must not concatenate
