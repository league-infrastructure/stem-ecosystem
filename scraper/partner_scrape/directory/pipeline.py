"""Directory pipeline orchestration: `Registry -> PlaceSource(s)/
ClubSource(s)/OfferingSource(s) -> geo fallback/geocoding -> export`.

Structurally parallel to `teams.pipeline.run_teams()` -- this module's
whole job is sequencing, not business logic (see that module's own
docstring for the same self-check): enumerate this subsystem's own
Registry (`directory/registry/`, not `partner_scrape/registry/
sources/` and not `teams/registry/`), dispatch each active source to
its `PlaceSource`, `ClubSource`, or `OfferingSource` implementation via
`directory.sources.base.run()`/`run_club_source()`/
`run_offering_source()`, resolve location for `Place`/`Club` through
the shared offline geocoding ladder (`geo_ladder.GeoLadder`, ticket
018-006) -- **`Offering` has no geocoding stage at all, see below** --
and hand the accumulated `Place[]`/`Club[]`/`Offering[]` to
`directory.export.export_directory()`. It never imports
`partner_scrape.pipeline`, `partner_scrape.adapters`, or
`partner_scrape.teams` -- see `directory/sources/base.py`'s module
docstring for why the `teams`-avoidance boundary in particular is
structural (sprint.md's Design Rationale: importing `teams/` from
`directory/` would be "a semantically backwards dependency").

**Ticket 018-007 wired Places only; ticket 018-008 added the analogous
`Club`-side dispatch; sprint 030 ticket 001 (this ticket) adds a third,
`Offering`-side dispatch.** `_PLACE_SOURCES`/`_apply_geo_fallback()`
are unchanged from ticket 007; `_CLUB_SOURCES`/
`_apply_club_geocoding()` are unchanged from ticket 018-008.
`_OFFERING_SOURCES` is this ticket's own addition, following that same
shape rather than importing from either (there is nothing to import --
`Place`, `Club`, and `Offering` are separate flat dataclasses, per
sprint.md's Design Rationale) -- **with one deliberate structural
difference: there is no `_apply_offering_geocoding()` counterpart at
all.** An `Offering` carries no location/geocoding fields (see
`directory/model.py`'s `Offering` docstring and this sprint's
`directory/DESIGN.md` Revision for the full "why" -- it is a program
hosted by an already-locatable org, not a place to travel to in its own
right), so no `GeoLadder` dependency is added for it and no fallback
stage runs over the acquired `Offering[]` list at all.

**One combined dispatch loop, not three separate ones, despite
`directory/DESIGN.md`'s forward-looking note describing "a new
`_CLUB_SOURCES` table and acquisition loop."** A literal second/third
`for` loop over the same `sources` list would make an earlier loop log
a spurious "no PlaceSource/ClubSource registered" warning for every
real Club/Offering registry entry (its `adapter_type` is never in that
earlier table) -- implementation judgment ticket 007's own DESIGN.md
explicitly left open ("ticket 007/008's implementation judgment"),
extended identically to a third table by this ticket. One loop that
checks `_PLACE_SOURCES` then `_CLUB_SOURCES` then `_OFFERING_SOURCES`
per `source_config` dispatches each registry entry to exactly the one
table it actually belongs to, and only warns when an `adapter_type` is
in none of the three. `directory.export.export_directory()` is now
called with a real `offerings` argument too; see that module's own
docstring for how `offerings.json` is written alongside `places.json`/
`clubs.json`.
