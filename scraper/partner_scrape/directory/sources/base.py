"""The pluggable ``PlaceSource``, ``ClubSource``, and ``OfferingSource``
contracts -- parallel to, and structurally disjoint from,
``teams.sources.base.TeamSource`` and ``adapters.base.Adapter``.

``sources/static_roster.py`` (ticket 018-007),
``sources/club_static_roster.py`` (ticket 018-008), and
``sources/offering_static_roster.py`` (sprint 030) each implement
``discover -> fetch -> extract``, the same three-method shape
``TeamSource``/``Adapter`` use -- reusing that mental model is
deliberate (see ``teams/sources/base.py``'s own docstring, which this
module's rationale mirrors exactly for ``Place``/``Club``/``Offering``
in place of ``Team``).

**``PlaceSource``, ``ClubSource``, and ``OfferingSource`` are three
separate ``Protocol``s, not one shared source contract.**
``Place.extract()``, ``Club.extract()``, and ``Offering.extract()``
return different record types, so a single ``Protocol`` typed
generically over "any of the three" would either lose real
type-checking or need a level of generic machinery this module's small
scope does not justify -- kept as three clearly-typed, near-identical
protocols instead, the same "field-name duplication accepted, no
shared base" tradeoff sprint 018's Design Rationale makes for the
``Place``/``Club``/``Offering`` record types themselves
(``directory/model.py``'s own docstring), extended here to the
record-specific source contracts for the identical reason.

What is **not** reused is ``adapters.base`` or ``teams.sources.base``
themselves. This module (and every module in ``directory/sources/``)
must never import anything from ``partner_scrape.adapters.base`` or
``partner_scrape.teams.sources.base`` -- a structural safety guarantee,
not a style preference: a place or club source reachable from
``adapters.base.ADAPTERS`` would become reachable from
``pipeline.run()``, which would hand a ``Place``/``Club`` object to
``normalize.run()`` -- a type it does not expect -- and crash.
``PlaceSource``/``ClubSource`` are their own ``Protocol``s with no
import relationship to either, so that failure mode cannot occur even
by accident. ``tests/directory/test_sources_base.py`` asserts this
boundary directly, following ``tests/teams/test_sources_base.py``'s
own forbidden-import-scan precedent.
