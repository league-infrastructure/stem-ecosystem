"""The canonical Place, Club, and Offering records (``directory/model.py``).

A ``Place`` is a curated, standing "where to go any day" San Diego
STEM venue -- a makerspace, planetarium, observatory, tidepool site,
nature center, or library maker lab -- with no date, no recurrence,
and no relevance gate, following the same shape ``teams.model.Team``
already established for a standing directory entity (issue 35, sprint
018's Design Rationale: "Places and Clubs ... following the same shape
robot teams already proved needs its own model").

A ``Club`` (ticket 018-008) is the same kind of standing directory
entity for a San Diego club chapter -- Hack Club chapters are this
sprint's one proof-of-concept type (issue 35's other six named club
types are split to issue 35b, a future sprint). See :class:`Club`'s
own docstring below for its full rationale.

An ``Offering`` (sprint 030) is a third standing directory entity: an
undated, non-recurring "here's what this org offers and how to get it"
record, serving both issue 14 Strategy B (volunteer org profiles) and
issue 33 part 2 (free/Title I school-program records) through one model
with an ``offering_type`` discriminator. Unlike `Place`/`Club`, an
`Offering` carries **no location/geocoding fields at all** -- see
:class:`Offering`'s own docstring for the full rationale.

**Deliberately three separate flat dataclasses, not a shared base
class.** Per sprint.md's Design Rationale ("`Place` and `Club` are
separate flat dataclasses, not a shared base class"), a `Club` has
membership/program concerns a `Place` doesn't (and vice versa for
hours/category concerns) -- forcing a shared base would either grow
speculative optional fields on both or under-model one of them.
Field-name duplication with `Team` (``website``, location fields,
``sources``) is accepted, matching the existing `Team`/`Event`
precedent `teams/model.py`'s own docstring cites -- and the same
duplication is accepted among `Place`, `Club`, and `Offering`
themselves, for the identical reason (sprint 030 extends this
three-way, per this sprint's `directory/DESIGN.md` Revision).

Every field defaults to an empty/neutral value so a bare ``Place()``,
``Club()``, or ``Offering()`` is always constructible, matching
``Team``'s and ``Event``'s existing convention.
