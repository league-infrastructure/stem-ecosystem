"""`export_directory()`: the Directory pipeline's `places.json`/
`clubs.json`/`offerings.json` publish entry point.

Publishes already-acquired `Place` records
(`directory.sources.static_roster`, ticket 018-007) as `places.json` --
an independent data contract alongside `export/writer.py`'s
`opportunities.json` and `teams/export.py`'s `teams.json`. Ticket
018-008 (Clubs) extends the same function with an optional `clubs`
argument that, when given, additionally publishes already-acquired
`Club` records (`directory.sources.club_static_roster`) as a
*second*, independent data contract, `clubs.json`. Sprint 030 ticket
001 (Offerings) extends the same function again with an optional
`offerings` argument that, when given, additionally publishes
already-acquired `Offering` records
(`directory.sources.offering_static_roster`) as a *third*, independent
data contract, `offerings.json`. This module does not re-derive or
re-map any field for any record type -- like `teams/export.py`, its job
is sort, serialize, write; there is no current/upcoming filter (Places,
Clubs, and Offerings are all undated) and no slug-uniqueness pass
(`place_id`/`club_id`/`offering_id` are already unique by construction
-- see `directory/DESIGN.md`'s Notes and `directory/model.py`'s
docstrings).

Sprint 017 first gave both files a sibling `stem-ecosystem` checkout
write target (`{site_dir}/src/data/` and `{site_dir}/public/data/`),
and sprint 020 (ticket 006, issue 60) added a third write target for
each, into partner-scrape's own `own_data_dir`
(the data Store, `config.get_data_store()`, by default) -- "one
publish, three paths" per file. Sprint 025 (ticket 005, issue 21 /
stop-writing-to-stem-ecosystem-checkout.md) removes both
`stem-ecosystem`-checkout writes for both files: `export_directory()`
no longer writes into a sibling checkout at all. `own_data_dir` is now
each file's sole write target -- "one publish, one path" -- mirroring
`teams/export.py`'s `export_teams()` (sprint 025 ticket 004) and
`export/writer.py`'s/`export/ads.py`'s own already-single write targets
(sprint 020 tickets 003/004). Unlike Teams, `directory/pipeline.py`'s
`run_directory()` keeps its own `site_dir` parameter --
`_check_related_partner_references()` still reads `{site_dir}/src/data/
partners.json` for the `related_partner_id` join-integrity check, a
real, independent use that has nothing to do with this function's
write; only the forwarding of `site_dir` into this function's call was
removed (see that module's own docstring).

## The `places.json` data contract

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "generated": "2026-08-31T04:13:41Z",
    "total": 19,
    "by_category": {"makerspace": 3, "planetarium": 2, ...},
    "by_location_precision": {"address": 18, "zip": 1}
  },
  "places": [ {"place_id": "sdpl-idea-lab-central", ...}, ... ]
}
```

`meta` travels *inside* `places.json` itself, the same self-describing
shape `teams.json` already established -- see that module's own
docstring for why (a `places` run's freshness must never be confused
with the opportunities or teams export's own).

## The `clubs.json` data contract (ticket 018-008)

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "generated": "2026-08-31T04:13:41Z",
    "total": 4,
    "by_club_type": {"hack-club": 4},
    "by_location_precision": {"school": 4}
  },
  "clubs": [ {"club_id": "hack-club-university-city-high", ...}, ... ]
}
```

Same self-describing-`meta`-travels-inside-the-file shape as
`places.json`, deliberately its own independent document rather than
nested inside `places.json` -- a `clubs` run's freshness/count must
never be confused with the places export's own, the identical
reasoning `places.json`'s own docstring section above gives for not
sharing `teams.json`'s `meta`.

**`export_directory()`'s returned `dict` stays backward compatible
with ticket 007's shape.** `payload["meta"]`/`payload["places"]` are
unchanged (still the places-only view ticket 007's own tests assert
against); the clubs view is added under new, separately-named
`payload["clubs_meta"]`/`payload["clubs"]` keys rather than nesting a
second `"meta"` inside the same flat dict (which would collide with
the places one). `clubs.json` itself is written from a genuinely
separate `{"meta": ..., "clubs": [...]}` document built internally,
not from those flat top-level keys -- the flat keys exist only for a
caller inspecting the returned payload in Python.

**`clubs` defaults to `None`, meaning "do not touch `clubs.json` at
all"** -- not "write an empty one." This preserves every ticket-007
call site/test that calls `export_directory(places)` with no `clubs`
argument unchanged: no `clubs.json` is written, exactly as before this
ticket. Passing `clubs=[]` (a real, empty list -- what
`directory.pipeline.run_directory()` passes when no `Club` source
acquired anything, e.g. under `--source places-sd`) *does* write a
`clubs.json` with `"total": 0` -- a legitimate "the clubs pipeline ran
and found nothing this time" result, distinct from "the clubs pipeline
was never asked to run" (`clubs=None`).

## The `offerings.json` data contract (sprint 030 ticket 001)

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "generated": "2026-09-02T04:13:41Z",
    "total": 13,
    "by_offering_type": {"volunteer": 6, "free_program": 7}
  },
  "offerings": [ {"offering_id": "fleet-science-center-volunteer", ...}, ... ]
}
```

Same self-describing-`meta`-travels-inside-the-file shape as
`places.json`/`clubs.json`, deliberately its own independent document
rather than nested inside either -- an `offerings` run's freshness/
count must never be confused with the places or clubs export's own,
the identical reasoning `places.json`'s own docstring section above
gives for not sharing `teams.json`'s `meta`. Unlike `places.json`'s/
`clubs.json`'s `by_location_precision` breakdown, there is no
`by_location_precision` here -- `Offering` carries no location fields
at all (see `directory/model.py`'s `Offering` docstring).

**`offerings` defaults to `None`, meaning "do not touch
`offerings.json` at all"** -- the identical contract `clubs` already
established, extended to a third file. Every pre-sprint-030 call site/
test that calls `export_directory(places)` (or
`export_directory(places, clubs=...)`) with no `offerings` argument is
unchanged: no `offerings.json` is written. Passing `offerings=[]` (a
real, empty list -- what `directory.pipeline.run_directory()` passes
when no `Offering` source acquired anything) *does* write an
`offerings.json` with `"total": 0`, the same "ran and found nothing"
vs. "never asked to run" distinction `clubs=[]` vs. `clubs=None`
already draws.

## Two hard invariants

This module **never** writes or touches `opportunities.json`,
`scrape-meta.json`, or `teams.json` -- those are `export/writer.py`'s
and `teams/export.py`'s exclusive outputs. Both invariants are covered
by a dedicated regression test (`tests/directory/test_export.py`)
asserting those three files are byte-identical before and after a
`directory` run, matching `tests/teams/test_export.py`'s own
`TestHardInvariants` precedent -- extended by sprint 030 ticket 001 to
also assert `offerings.json` is untouched when `offerings=None`.

A missing or unwritable `own_data_dir` fails loudly, matching
`export_teams`'s and `export_opportunities`'s contract exactly -- "fail
loudly, do not silently skip the export." This is now each file's
*only* write target (sprint 025 ticket 005 removed the two
`stem-ecosystem`-checkout writes this section used to also describe --
see the module docstring's own history of that removal above); the
`places.json` write is attempted, and must fully succeed, before the
`clubs.json` write (when `clubs is not None`) begins, and the
`clubs.json` write (when attempted) completes before the
`offerings.json` write (when `offerings is not None`) begins -- a
later file's failure never leaves an earlier one half written, and an
earlier file's write failure raises before any later file is ever
touched, the same "places before clubs" ordering principle as before,
now extended to "places before clubs before offerings." `own_data_dir`
is created automatically if it is a missing local directory, matching `teams/export.py`'s identical "not guaranteed to
exist yet" rationale.

            and tests omit this argument and see no behavior change.
            An explicit (possibly empty) list writes `clubs.json`. Same
            "no filter, no slug-uniqueness pass needed" properties as
            `places` above.
        offerings: acquired `Offering` records

            local directory is created automatically if missing. Tests should always pass an
            explicit `tmp_path` here, never rely on the default.
