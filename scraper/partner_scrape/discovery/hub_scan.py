"""Hub Scan: lead-generation discovery over one curated external hub.

See sprint.md's Architecture > Hub Scan, SUC-001, and the Design
Rationale ("Hub scanning is structurally separate from the Event/
Opportunity pipeline") -- the stakeholder was emphatic that we are the
aggregator; another aggregator's own records (a hub's own event listing)
must never become our data. This module enforces that structurally, not
just by convention:

- :func:`scan_hub` returns :class:`OrgCandidate` records only -- an org
  name, its *own* site URL, and a snippet of evidence text. It never
  constructs a :class:`partner_scrape.model.Event`.
- It never imports or calls anything in ``partner_scrape.normalize`` or
  ``partner_scrape.export`` -- a hub's own content can structurally never
  reach ``normalize.run()``/``export_opportunities()`` through this
  module, so ``opportunities.json`` can never be written from a hub scan
  no matter what a future caller does.
- The only exception is ``normalize.partners.normalize_org_name``, reused
  read-only for the dedup comparison below -- a pure string-normalization
  helper with no I/O and no Event/Opportunity concept, not a boundary
  this ticket's "never republish" guarantee is about.

This module depends only on ``Fetch & Cache``'s ``Fetcher`` protocol and
``fetch.robots.is_allowed`` (for per-page robots.txt compliance),
``registry.hub_schema.HubConfig``, and the Source Registry's own public
loader (``registry.loader.load_sources``) for the dedup check below --
never the ``Adapter`` protocol, dispatch table, or ``model.Event``.
