"""Sitemap-diff discovery: resolves a source's sitemap into new/changed URLs.

See ``sprint.md``'s Architecture > Sitemap Discovery, SUC-009, and sprint
005's Architecture > Design Rationale (root-sitemap probing hardening,
SUC-005). Fetches a source's root sitemap via the injected ``Fetcher`` --
either ``SourceConfig.config["sitemap_url"]`` directly, when set, or by
probing :data:`_ROOT_SITEMAP_FILENAMES` in order and accepting the first
candidate whose body both returns HTTP 200 *and* parses as recognized
sitemap XML (``<urlset>``/``<sitemapindex>``) -- a 200 response with a
non-parseable or wrong-root-element body (e.g. some static-site
generators serve a catch-all "not found" HTML page with status 200 for
any path) is logged and skipped rather than accepted, falling through to
the next candidate. It then identifies event/program-related URLs by
sitemap child-filename pattern (recursing into a ``<sitemapindex>``) or
by URL-path pattern for sites with no dedicated event sitemap, and diffs
the resulting ``{url: lastmod}`` set against a persisted snapshot for
``source.source_id`` under ``SCRAPE_CACHE_DIR`` -- only new or
``<lastmod>``-changed URLs come back as ``EventRef``s, and the snapshot
is rewritten to the current full state on every successful resolution.

Classification patterns were originally ported, as a starting point and
never a dependency, from a since-deleted early prototype's
``EVENT_PATTERNS``/``PROGRAM_PATTERNS`` and inline event-path regex
(``dev/inventory_sitemaps.py`` and ``dev/lib/sitemap_parser.py``, both
long removed -- see git history).

This module depends only on ``Fetch & Cache``'s ``Fetcher`` protocol,
``Config``, ``registry.schema.SourceConfig``, and ``adapters.base.EventRef``
(a plain, logic-free data shape shared by every adapter's ``discover()``,
imported directly from ``adapters.base`` rather than the heavier
``adapters`` package so no dispatch table or concrete adapter is pulled
in) -- never the ``Adapter`` protocol or dispatch table itself. Ticket
002's ``generic_html`` adapter calls into this module, never the other
way around (sprint.md's dependency-direction check).
