"""Tests for partner_scrape.cli's `teams` subcommand (sprint 011,
ticket 002).

Mirrors `test_cli.py`'s existing convention exactly:
`TestArgumentWiring`-style classes monkeypatch `cli.run_teams` to prove
flag parsing/wiring only, and `TestTeamsEndToEnd` exercises the real
`run_teams()` -> `FTCScoutSource` chain against the actual seeded
`partner_scrape/teams/registry/ftc-sd.toml`, substituting only
`cli.PoliteFetcher` with a fixture double so no real socket is opened --
the same substitution point `TestDiscoverCandidatesEndToEnd` in
`test_cli.py` already uses for its own subcommand.

    `run_teams()` -- even in wiring tests that monkeypatch `cli.run_teams`
    itself -- and `PoliteFetcher()`'s default `cache_dir` reads
    `SCRAPE_CACHE_DIR` eagerly (see `config.get_scrape_cache_store`'s "no
    sane default" `RuntimeError`). `SITE_DIR` is pinned too, matching
    `test_cli.py`'s own `_cache_dir` fixture, even though the `teams`
    subcommand this file tests no longer reads it at all (sprint 025
    ticket 004 removed its `--site-dir` flag along with every
    `SITE_DIR`-adjacent write `run_teams()` used to make). `TBA_KEY` is
    unset unconditionally too (ticket 011-003):
    the real seeded registry this class runs against now also loads
    `frc-sd.toml`, and `TBA_KEY` is a real, working credential in this
    project's own `.env` -- without this, a run on a machine with that
    `.env` sourced could silently behave differently than one without
    it (the fixture Fetchers below only register FTCScout's URL).
    Tests that need a valid key set it explicitly.

    Sprint 020 ticket 005: also pins `export.get_data_store()`'s
    resolution to a throwaway directory. `TestTeamsEndToEnd.
    test_real_run_writes_teams_json` and
    `test_never_writes_opportunities_json_or_scrape_meta_anywhere` drive
    the real `cli.main(["teams", ...])` -> `run_teams()` ->
    `export_teams()` chain without `--dry-run`, and `run_teams()` never
    passes `own_data_dir` through -- without this, those calls would
    write real files into this repo's actual `data/` directory on every
    test run. Mirrors `tests/teams/test_pipeline.py`'s identical
    `_own_data_dir_default` fixture, folded into this file's existing
    single autouse fixture rather than a second one.

    Sprint 020 ticket 007: also pins `cli.get_data_store()`'s
    resolution to the same throwaway directory.
    `TestNeverCrossesIntoTheOtherPipeline.test_default_run_never_calls_run_teams`
    drives the real no-subcommand/`run` path via `cli.main([])`
    (reporting enabled by default, no `--dry-run`) -- as of ticket 007,
    that path writes `yield-history.json` into `cli.get_data_store()`
    a second time, alongside the `SITE_DIR` copy. Without pinning this
    too, that single test would write a real `yield-history.json` into
    this repo's actual `data/` directory on every test run.
