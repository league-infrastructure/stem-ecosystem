"""Dataset-validity regression tests for the curated Hack Club chapters
roster (`partner_scrape/directory/data/hack-club-sd.tsv`), and for the
whole `directory/` package's data as it stands after ticket 018-008.

Data-only-ticket tests, matching sprint.md's Test Strategy precedent
for a curated dataset (ticket 003's own `TestBatchARegistryJoinIntegrity`
class, and `tests/directory/test_dataset_validity.py`'s own precedent
for the Places roster): these pin down properties of the *real*
committed data -- unique ids, the four named chapters present, no
live-geocoded coordinate, and (this ticket's own explicit exclusion)
San Diego Math Circle/SDAA never appearing as `Club` records -- rather
than a synthetic fixture, so a future edit to `hack-club-sd.tsv` that
regresses one of these is caught directly.
