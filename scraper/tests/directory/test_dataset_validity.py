"""Dataset-validity regression tests for the curated Places roster
(`partner_scrape/directory/data/places.toml`), plus (sprint 032 ticket
001) a `Club`-side id-uniqueness check that spans every active
`club_static_roster` registry entry combined.

Data-only-ticket tests, matching sprint.md's Test Strategy precedent
for a curated dataset (ticket 003's own registry-source-name tests):
these pin down properties of the *real* committed data -- unique ids,
in-bounding-box coordinates, no hijacked domain, and category coverage
-- rather than a synthetic fixture, so a future edit to `places.toml`
that regresses one of these is caught directly.

Sprint 019 ticket 002 removed `partner-scrape/site/` as a tracked
directory (build-time-only CI checkout of `stem-ecosystem` now), which
took `site/src/data/partners.json` with it. The `related_partner_id`
join-integrity check that used to verify each hand-copied
`related_partner_id` resolves against that file is tracked for recovery
as pipeline-level validation in issue 48, not reproduced here against a
re-copied fixture (that would recreate the exact two-copies-of-the-
same-file problem the site consolidation exists to eliminate).

**`TestClubUniqueIds`, added by sprint 032 ticket 001**, deliberately
lives in this Place-focused module rather than
`test_club_dataset_validity.py` (per that ticket's own AC: "extending
the existing Place-only `TestUniqueIds` pattern"). Unlike
`test_club_dataset_validity.py`'s own `TestUniqueIds` (scoped to the
single `hack-club-sd` registry entry), this class aggregates *every*
active `club_static_roster` registry entry -- the property that
matters once issue 35b's six new club-type rosters (sprint 032 tickets
002-007) each add their own TSV/registry entry is uniqueness *across*
files, not just within one.
