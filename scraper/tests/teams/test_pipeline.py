"""Tests for partner_scrape.teams.pipeline: `run_teams()`'s
Registry -> TeamSource(s) -> merge_teams() -> export_teams() sequencing.

Drives the real Team Registry seed (`partner_scrape/teams/registry/
ftc-sd.toml` + `frc-sd.toml` + `fll-sd.toml`, the same ones production
loads) through a fixture Fetcher returning the live-captured 152-team
FTCScout fixture and (ticket 011-003, reopened) a curated 7-team subset
of the live-captured TBA fixture (see `tests/teams/test_sources_tba.py`'s
module docstring for why 7, not the real 78) -- no test here opens a
real network socket, and no test relies on a synthetic registry
standing in for the real one (except the two tests that specifically
need an unrecognized/erroring source, which use their own small
fixture registries under `tests/fixtures/teams/`).

Sprint 012's `fll-sd.toml` is a third real, always-active registry
entry whose `StaticRosterSource` never touches the injected fetcher (it
reads the real, committed 48-team roster straight off disk -- see
`sources/static_roster.py`'s own module docstring), so it contributes
its 48 teams to *every* unfiltered `run_teams()` call in this file
regardless of what the fixture Fetcher registers or whether TBA
succeeds. Several tests below that predate sprint 012 either add an
explicit `source="ftcscout"` filter (where the point is FTCScout's
behavior specifically) or have their expected totals/`by_league`
updated to include the FLL roster's 48 -- see each affected test's own
comment for which.

    `credential_failures` value also sets `ROBOTEVENTS_KEY` to a
    fixture key (without registering any RobotEvents fixture response)
