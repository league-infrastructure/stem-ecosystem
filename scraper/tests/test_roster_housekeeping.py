"""Sprint 018 ticket 002 (issue 32 housekeeping) verification.

These tests run against the registry TOML sources -- not synthetic
fixtures, because their whole purpose is to guard the *actual* roster
data against regressing back into the defects sprint 018 fixed: the
bare-California geocoder centroid, pins outside the site map's bounding
box, the hijacked `batiquitosfoundation.org` domain, and registry source
org_name drift.

Sprint 019 ticket 002 removed `partner-scrape/site/` as a tracked
directory (it is now a build-time-only CI checkout of `stem-ecosystem`),
which took the JSON-side half of these guards (`site/src/data/
partners.json`, `site/public/images/logos/`) with it -- there is no
longer a local file for a hermetic test to read. Sprint 020 ticket 002
then deleted `data/partners_viable.csv` itself (confirmed dead, zero
production readers -- issue 60), which took the CSV-side half
(`TestNoBareCaliforniaCentroid`, `TestNoOutOfBoundsCoordinates`,
`TestNoHijackedDomain`, and their shared `_load_partners_csv()` helper)
with it. Most of those guards (bare-California-centroid, out-of-bounds,
hijacked-domain, and JSON/CSV sync checks against `partners.json`, plus
the JSON-side registry join-integrity check) were tracked for recovery
as pipeline-level validation in issue 48, and recovered by sprint 022
tickets 002-004 (`partner_scrape.registry.validate_roster`, wired into
`pipeline.run()` and `directory.pipeline.run_directory()`) -- not
reproduced here against a re-copied fixture (that would recreate the
exact two-copies-of-the-same-file problem the site consolidation exists
to eliminate). The logo-backfill check (the old
`TestLogoBackfillIntegrity`) is explicitly *not* part of that recovery
-- issue 48's own Proposed Fix never listed it, and it would need a
different validation surface entirely (the actual image files under
`{site_dir}/public/images/logos/`, not just `partners.json`'s own
structure); see sprint 022's sprint.md Scope > Out of Scope. Only the
registry-TOML-side guards below survive locally, since they have no
dependency on either retired file. The bounding-box constant that
guarded coordinates against `site/src/pages/partners/index.astro`'s
`SD_BOUNDS` (San Diego County's lat/lng box) went with
`TestNoOutOfBoundsCoordinates`; `validate_roster.SD_BOUNDS` is the
recovered guard's own copy of that same box.
